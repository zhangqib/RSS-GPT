Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69% test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of face image quality in face verification systems, highlighting how low-quality images can adversely affect performance. The proposed framework focuses on automatic face quality assessment using facial landmarks and a Random Forest Regression classifier, achieving a high accuracy rate of 96.67%. By integrating this module into the verification process, the framework significantly reduces false rejection rates by 99.7% and enhances cosine similarity scores with the ArcFace model. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Dubai Police show the framework's effectiveness in addressing challenges like face resolution variations and pose deviations common in surveillance scenarios. The framework outperforms existing techniques while maintaining computational efficiency, making it a valuable tool for improving the reliability of face recognition systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control. Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an accuracy of 96.67%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance, including a comfortable 99.7% reduction in the false rejection rate and enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening: variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent in practical surveillance scenarios.

<div> modular framework, multi-agent orchestration, runtime personalization, workflow adherence, LLM-based systems <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework called WARPP that enhances workflow adherence in large language models (LLMs) used in task-oriented dialogue systems. WARPP combines multi-agent orchestration with runtime personalization to dynamically adjust workflow paths based on user attributes, reducing reasoning overhead and improving tool selection during execution. The framework features a parallelized architecture where a Personalizer agent works alongside domain-specific agents to customize execution paths in real-time. Evaluation of WARPP across various user intents in banking, flights, and healthcare domains shows superior performance compared to non-personalized methods and a ReAct baseline. As intent complexity increases, WARPP achieves better parameter fidelity, tool accuracy, and reduced token usage without the need for additional training. <div>
arXiv:2507.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime. WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains: banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

<div> Keywords: hypergame theory, agent-based modeling, multi-agent systems, cognitive constraints, strategic modeling

Summary: 
This systematic review explores the application of hypergame theory in multi-agent systems (MAS) where classical game theory assumptions such as rationality and complete information are often not met. The study focuses on agent-compatible adaptations of hypergame theory in dynamic MAS scenarios. It analyzes 44 selected studies across various fields including cybersecurity, robotics, and social simulation. The review introduces hierarchical hypergames and HNF extensions of hypergame theory, develops agent-compatibility criteria, and offers a classification framework for assessing practical applicability. The analysis highlights prevalent tendencies such as the use of hierarchical and graph-based models for deceptive reasoning. It also identifies structural gaps in the adoption of HNF-based models, the need for formal hypergame languages, and opportunities for modeling misalignment between human agents and artificial agents. By synthesizing trends and challenges, this review provides a roadmap for enhancing strategic modeling realism in complex multi-agent environments. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints, subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic multi-agent environments.

<div> Framework, Large Language Models, Edge Devices, Attention Sparsity, Efficient Inference

Summary: 
DeltaLLM is a training-free framework designed for efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. It exploits temporal sparsity in attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices. The framework introduces a delta matrix construction strategy and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism to increase accuracy while reducing memory usage. Evaluation on BitNet and Llama models shows up to 60% attention sparsity during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both prefilling and decoding stages. On the BitNet model, there is a slight accuracy improvement on the WG task and a higher F1 score on the SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, similar attention sparsity levels are achieved with negligible accuracy drop. DeltaLLM offers a promising solution for efficient edge deployment, seamlessly integrating with existing inference pipelines without the need for fine-tuning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length. Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97 on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society. Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ), highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment. This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, uncertainty, reliability, error pileup, degenerative AI behavior

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) face limitations in improving prediction uncertainty due to scaling laws. The mechanism allowing LLMs to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian inputs may contribute to error accumulation and degenerative AI behavior. This tension between learning power and accuracy is exacerbated by the proliferation of spurious correlations in data sets. The risk of a degenerative AI pathway in LLMs can be mitigated by prioritizing insight and understanding of problem structures in AI research. Avoiding such negative outcomes requires higher emphasis on the structural characteristics of the problems being studied.Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs, namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being investigated.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Intrinsic Motivation, Reward Sparsity, Reward Hacking, Generalized Reward Matching 

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning agents face challenges in games due to sparse rewards, which can be addressed using Intrinsic Motivation (IM) techniques. However, IM can lead to reward hacking, where agents prioritize new rewards over optimal gameplay. This study evaluates the impact of three IM techniques on behavior in the MiniGrid environment. The results indicate that IM increases initial rewards but also alters agent behavior. Generalized Reward Matching (GRM) shows promise in mitigating reward hacking in some instances. This research provides valuable insights into the effects of IM on RL agents and highlights the importance of addressing reward hacking to ensure optimal performance.

arXiv:2507.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However, IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some scenarios.

Summary:
The paper introduces HypKG, a framework that integrates patient information from electronic health records (EHRs) into knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions. By linking relevant knowledge from general KGs with patient data from EHRs using entity-linking techniques, HypKG contextualizes the knowledge with patient information through a hypergraph model. This framework leverages hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to jointly learn appropriate contextualized representations for both KGs and patients. Experimental results using a large biomedical KG and real-world EHR datasets show significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks. By integrating patient contexts from EHRs, HypKG can adjust entity and relation representations in KGs, potentially enhancing the quality and utility of knowledge for real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing general factual information often lack the ability to account for important contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs) provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions. Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally, we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients, fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts, HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG, potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

Summary: 
Ontology-structured knowledge graphs are proposed to predict future events, using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies (CCO). Data on a fishing vessel's movements are organized in a knowledge graph, enabling Markov chain models for future state predictions. The concept of 'spatiotemporal instant' is introduced for structural semantics. Critique is made on the prevailing ontological model of probability, proposing a process profile-based view instead. Integration of Markov chain probability calculations back into the knowledge graph allows for further analysis and decision-making. The study emphasizes the distinction between probability and likelihood, rejecting modal measurements of future entities. The method shows the dynamics of real-world phenomena and how probabilities are about process profiles. This approach enhances predictive analytics and decision support in various fields. <div>

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies (CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term `spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics. Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability, which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally, we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis and decision-making.

The paper introduces ASPBench, a new comprehensive ASP benchmark that includes tasks specifically designed for Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. Current evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in ASP are limited, often using simplified programs that do not support negation, disjunction, or multiple answer sets. The study evaluates 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on three ASP tasks: ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. While LLMs perform well on simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is essential for ASP solving. The findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in ASP and suggest a need for new approaches integrating symbolic reasoning effectively. The code and dataset for ASPBench are available on GitHub at https://github.com/HomuraT/ASPBench. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks: ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and \emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively.

Summary: This study introduces a novel multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain optimisation model that considers economic, environmental, and social factors in non-stationary markets. The model utilizes a multi-objective reinforcement learning method and is compared against a single-objective RL algorithm and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Through experiments in various network complexities, the model determines production and delivery quantities to achieve balanced trade-offs between objectives. It surpasses the MOEA-based method in hypervolume by up to 75% and generates denser solutions. Additionally, it maintains stable production and inventory levels while minimizing demand loss. The model's primary approach, enhanced with a shared experience buffer for knowledge transfer, proves to be highly effective in complex scenarios, showcasing robustness and efficiency in problem-solving. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method, benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality, diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

<div> counterfactual prompt learning, robust feature generalization, DiCap model, causal invariance, contrastive learning<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the DiCap model, a diffusion-based counterfactual prompt learning framework designed to address challenges in achieving causally invariant prompts for efficient model training. The model leverages a diffusion process to sample gradients from marginal and conditional distributions of a causal model, ensuring the identification of counterfactual outcomes with minimal estimation errors. By employing a contrastive learning framework, the model extracts prompts aligned with causal features in the data, resulting in excellent performance across tasks like image classification and visual question answering, with particular strength in unseen categories. The DiCap model's theoretically grounded approach promises robust feature generalization and superior performance in various applications, making it a promising advancement in prompt learning techniques. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual $\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations, this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong advantages in unseen categories.

<title>What Does 'Human-Centred AI' Mean?</title>

<div> Keywords: human-centred AI, cognition, sociotechnical relationships, enhancement, replacement

Summary:
Artificial intelligence (AI) should always center around human behavior and experience, as it ultimately involves technology performing cognitive tasks. The relationship between AI and humans can be categorized into displacement, enhancement, or replacement of human cognitive labor. Examples such as the abacus versus mental arithmetic highlight how AI can either harm, benefit, or neutrally impact human cognition. It is crucial to acknowledge that all AI involves human cognition in some way, and obfuscating this reality can distort critical engagement with AI systems. To truly prioritize humans in AI engineering, we must recognize the human-in-the-loop aspect and address sociotechnical relationships. By de-fetishizing AI and focusing on the human aspect, it becomes possible to better understand the implications of AI on human cognition and society. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context -- from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems. To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the eyes.

<div> Keyword: pancreatic cystic lesion, large language models, MRI/CT reports, risk categorization, radiology<br />
Summary: 
- Large language models (LLMs) were developed to automatically extract pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from MRI/CT reports and assign risk categories based on guidelines.
- A training dataset of 6,000 reports was used to fine-tune LLMs using QLoRA and Chain-of-Thought prompting, improving feature extraction accuracy and risk categorization.
- Evaluation on 285 human-annotated reports showed high accuracy in feature extraction and risk categorization for both LLMs, comparable to GPT-4o performance.
- Radiologist review of model outputs demonstrated high agreement levels, indicating that LLMs achieved agreement levels on par with radiologists.
- Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision enable accurate and efficient phenotyping for large-scale PCL research, with performance comparable to GPT-4o. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models (LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134 patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79% to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved (LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

<div> Keywords: 6G networks, resource allocation, digital twin channel, real-time channel state information, online optimization

Summary: 
6G networks require flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation for applications like holographic communication and autonomous driving. Traditional methods relying on statistical modeling may not be optimal for dynamic environments and real-time channel state information (CSI) incurs high pilot overhead. A solution proposed is a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled framework for online optimization. DTC predicts CSI using environmental sensing, allowing lightweight game-theoretic algorithms for efficient resource allocation. Simulations in an industrial workshop setting show up to 11.5% throughput improvement compared to ideal CSI schemes, validating the method for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication in 6G networks.

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving, and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks. Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication in future 6G networks.

Summary: <br />
This perspective paper discusses the potential of combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with GRAPHYP's network system to enhance conversational intelligence. The proposed framework, "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large Language Models (D-LLMs)," aims to personalize AI by incorporating individual user preferences into decision-making. The framework consists of reasoning processes, classification systems, and dialogue approaches to analyze search experiences, identify user preference patterns, and resolve conflicting information. The goal is to create an interpretable AI system where users can understand and combine different human preferences that influence AI responses, leading to more transparent and trustworthy artificial intelligence for human decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2507.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to share their different preferences through structured conversations. This approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine, understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

<br />
In the study, the researchers focus on the Stable Roommates problem, which involves agents' preferences for roommates. A solution to this problem is a stable matching where pairs of agents are acceptable to each other based on their preference lists. The researchers aim to compute "good-enough" matchings when stable solutions are not possible. They consider agents' habits, habitual preferences, and networks of preferred friends to generate personalized solutions. By introducing a method to address stable roommates problems with these factors in mind, the researchers illustrate the practical applications of their approach through examples and empirical evaluations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching). Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute "good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical evaluations.

Summary:
PITA introduces a novel framework for large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs aligned with user preferences at inference time. By integrating preference feedback directly into token generation, PITA eliminates the need for a pre-trained reward model, reducing computational cost and instability in the fitting process. The framework learns a preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities without LLM fine-tuning. The problem is addressed through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the guidance model to identify the underlying preference distribution. Evaluation across tasks like mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification shows PITA's effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation, eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of transparency and interoperability in applying neural networks to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A novel value-based method called Concepts learning for Multi-agent Q-learning (CMQ) is proposed to address these challenges by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. By representing each cooperation concept as a supervised vector and conditioning action values on global state embeddings, CMQ achieves superior performance in the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) compared to existing models. The results also show that CMQ captures meaningful cooperation modes and allows for test-time concept interventions to detect biases and identify spurious artifacts affecting cooperation. <div>

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models, which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem, we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic. Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Summary:
This paper introduces a mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of reinforcement learning in large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). It addresses issues such as spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that arise from brittle and unstable policies. The framework explains these failures as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards in the presence of non-unique optimal actions and action degeneracy. It extends the analysis to multi-reward RL, showing how stability is influenced by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. The study also demonstrates that entropy regularization can improve policy stability at the expense of increased stochasticity. The findings offer a unified explanation for various failures in LLMs/LRMs and provide insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

Summary:
HFrame is introduced as a novel graph neural network-based framework for the subgraph homomorphism problem, which involves mapping patterns to graphs while preserving their structure. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, homomorphism allows for non-one-to-one mappings, making the problem more complex. HFrame combines traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques to achieve superior performance compared to standard graph neural networks. It can discern more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph and offers a generalization error bound. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic graphs demonstrate that HFrame is significantly faster than exact matching algorithms, achieving an average accuracy of 0.962. <div>

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph, making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction. We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score: 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction. This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical research.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&amp;D. Traditional approaches to solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming, manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning, and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&amp;D teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability, and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances decision making in complex R&amp;D environments.

<div> Curse of high-dimensional representations, linear structures, activation engineering, safety alignment, large language models<br />
<br />
The paper explores the impact of high-dimensional representations in large language models (LLMs) on safety alignment. While the increase in dimensions has been advantageous for LLMs, it may also lead to emergent problems such as vulnerability to exploitation through activation engineering. Visualizing linear subspaces associated with different concepts reveals that the curse of high-dimensional representations uniquely affects LLMs. By projecting model representations onto lower dimensional subspaces, alignment can be preserved while avoiding linear structures that can be exploited. Empirical results support the effectiveness of dimensional reduction in reducing susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation engineering. Theoretical insights provide a deeper understanding of linear jailbreaking methods in relation to a model's hidden dimensions, highlighting both the benefits and drawbacks of high-dimensional representations in safety alignment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering, to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety alignment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, autonomous driving, motion planning, vision-language model, real-time planner 

Summary: 
The paper introduces VLMPlanner, a framework that combines a vision-language model with a real-time planner to enhance decision-making in autonomous driving. The VLM processes raw images to capture detailed visual information and utilizes common-sense reasoning to assist the planner in generating safe trajectories. Additionally, the proposed Context-Adaptive Inference Gate (CAI-Gate) allows the VLM to adjust its inference frequency based on scene complexity, ensuring optimal planning performance and computational efficiency. Experimental results on the nuPlan benchmark show superior performance in complex driving scenarios. This integration of large language models into motion planning presents a promising approach for achieving robust and adaptable decision-making in autonomous vehicles. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich, detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate (CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity, thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale, challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

<div> reinforcement learning, mobility resource allocation, multi-agent, adaptive grouping, parameter sharing <br />
<br />Summary: 
The study introduces a new approach, Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS), for dynamic mobility resource allocation in urban environments. HAG-PS addresses two key challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility resource allocation by dynamically sharing allocation policies across agents and achieving memory-efficient parameter sharing. The approach incorporates global and local information, adaptive agent grouping based on encoded trajectories, and learnable ID embeddings for agent specialization. Experimental studies using real-world NYC bike sharing data show HAG-PS outperforms baseline methods in improving bike availability through enhanced resource distribution. <div>

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS) for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources); and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Summary: 
- The study introduces MazeEval, a benchmark to assess pure spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) through maze navigation tasks without visual cues.
- Eight state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated on maze navigation tasks in English and Icelandic, revealing significant disparities in performance.
- OpenAI's O3 model demonstrated perfect navigation for smaller mazes, while other models failed beyond certain maze sizes due to excessive looping behavior.
- Performance degradation was observed in Icelandic compared to English, indicating spatial reasoning in LLMs may be influenced by linguistic patterns.
- The study highlights the importance of training data availability and architectural innovations for reliable spatial navigation in LLM-powered autonomous systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.

Summary:
The article discusses the vulnerability of LLM-powered AI agents in following deployment policies in realistic environments, particularly under attack. The researchers conducted a large-scale red-teaming competition targeting 22 AI agents in 44 deployment scenarios, resulting in 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks with over 60,000 policy violations. The Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark was created from these attacks and evaluated across 19 models, showing high attack transferability and limited correlation between agent robustness and model size or capability. The study highlights critical and persistent vulnerabilities in current AI agent deployments, emphasizing the need for additional defenses against adversarial misuse. The release of the ART benchmark aims to support more comprehensive security assessment and promote safer agent deployment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across 19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent deployment.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that revolutionizes Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). MeLA leverages a new paradigm by evolving instructional prompts for a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate heuristics, instead of directly manipulating heuristic code. The system employs a metacognitive framework to analyze performance feedback, refine its generative strategy, and optimize the prompt iteratively for heuristic effectiveness. MeLA integrates a problem analyzer, error diagnosis system, and metacognitive search engine to enhance the quality and robustness of generated heuristics. Through extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of cognitive science principles in AI architecture. By enabling LLMs to metacognitively regulate problem-solving processes, MeLA offers a more robust and interpretable approach to Automatic Heuristic Design. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

<div> knowledge unlearning, knowledge graph embedding, GraphDPO, direct preference optimization, unlearning datasets

Summary:
GraphDPO is a novel approximate unlearning framework for knowledge graphs that addresses the challenges of removing outdated or erroneous knowledge while preserving the integrity of remaining information. By reframing unlearning as a preference optimization problem, GraphDPO effectively removes forgetting triples by training the model to prefer reconstructed alternatives. It introduces an out-boundary sampling strategy to weaken the connection between forgetting and retained knowledge. Additionally, GraphDPO preserves boundary knowledge through a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills relevant information. Experimental results on eight unlearning datasets across four popular knowledge graphs show that GraphDPO outperforms existing methods in MRR_Avg and MRR_F1 metrics by up to 10.1% and 14.0%, respectively. <div>
arXiv:2507.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity. Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates. Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency. Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers, using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and 13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing much performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel convolutional architecture for accurate time series forecasting by enhancing the fuzzy time series construction method to extract short and long term temporal interrelations automatically. A bilateral Atrous algorithm is developed to reduce computation while maintaining global characteristics, and a partially asymmetric convolutional design allows for flexible feature mining in different directions within sliding windows. Multi-scale features from sub-windows are fused for improved modeling. The proposed model outperforms other modern forecasting models on popular time series datasets, as confirmed by experimental results. <div>
arXiv:2507.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the experimental results.

Summary:
Dynamic Multi-Agent Path Finding (D-MAPF) is a problem that involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in dynamically changing environments. This study introduces a new framework for solving D-MAPF, utilizing multi-shot computation and offering different methods for solving the problem. Additionally, an ASP-based method is proposed, combining the advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with the innovative concept of tunnels to specify agent movement spaces.

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles. Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF (D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce 1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

<div> Keywords: Fairness, AI, runtime property, monitoring, enforcement

Summary: 
Fairness in AI is typically examined as a fixed property on a static dataset, but real-world AI systems operate sequentially with evolving outcomes and environments. This paper introduces a framework to analyze fairness as a runtime property using a model based on sequences of coin tosses with changing biases. It explores the challenges of monitoring and enforcing fairness in toss outcomes or coin biases, offering various strategies based on environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence thresholds. General results are provided for both monitoring and enforcement problems under different assumptions. Solutions for monitoring with Markovian and additive dynamics, as well as enforcement in static settings with known dynamics, are also discussed. This framework addresses the complex and evolving nature of fairness in AI systems, laying the groundwork for more adaptive and equitable algorithms.

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once, over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies, parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement problem in static settings with known dynamics.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, human values, value-based preferences, value learning, heuristic deep clustering

Summary:
This article introduces the concept of aligning AI systems with human values and value-based preferences to ensure ethical AI development. It discusses the challenges of eliciting and calibrating individual values and proposes a value learning approach to automatically derive computational models of an agent's values. The article emphasizes the importance of considering society's value system as a collection of different groups' value systems rather than a simple aggregation of individual values. To address this, the article formalizes the problem of learning society's value systems and presents a method based on heuristic deep clustering. This method aims to learn socially shared value groundings and diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative value-based preferences from multiple agents. The proposed approach is evaluated through a use case involving real data on traveling decisions. The study highlights the significance of incorporating societal values into AI systems for more ethical and value-aligned decision-making.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour. Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a use case with real data about travelling decisions.

Summary: <br />
Automated voice calls using AI technology have been successful in disseminating maternal and child health information, but often face issues such as dropoffs and poor engagement. Through real-world trials, a restless bandit AI model was found to effectively target beneficiaries in need of live service call interventions, leading to improved engagement and prevention of dropoffs. A new study now reveals that these AI-targeted interventions not only enhance listenership but also result in significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors, such as taking supplements postnatally and understanding critical health topics. This research highlights the potential of AI in driving positive changes in maternal and child health outcomes. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-Thought prompting, model reasoning, decoding space pruner, answer templates, neuron engagement

Summary:
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that boosts model reasoning, but its inner workings are not well understood. This study delves into CoT's operational principles by analyzing information flow during decoding, projection, and activation phases. The analysis suggests that CoT acts as a decoder space pruner, using answer templates to enhance output generation, and better adherence to templates leads to improved performance. Surprisingly, CoT adjusts neuron engagement differently based on the task, decreasing activation in open-domain tasks and increasing it in closed-domain ones. These insights provide a new framework for understanding CoT's mechanisms and offer valuable guidance for optimizing prompts to enhance efficiency and robustness. The code and data for this study are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cot-D247.<br /><br />Summary: Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances model reasoning by serving as a decoding space pruner guided by answer templates. Improved template adherence correlates with better performance. CoT adjusts neuron engagement task-dependently, decreasing in open-domain tasks and increasing in closed-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection, and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust prompts. We released our code and data at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cot-D247.

Summary:
Smart contract comment generation is essential for enhancing code comprehension in blockchain systems. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are inadequate for evaluating comment quality due to their inability to capture domain-specific nuances. Human evaluation is costly and not scalable. To address these challenges, the paper introduces \texttt{evalSmarT}, a flexible framework that uses large language models (LLMs) for evaluation. With over 400 evaluator configurations using 40 LLMs and 10 prompting strategies, \texttt{evalSmarT} enables benchmarking of comment generation tools and selection of the most informative outputs.

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However, evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present \texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies. We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing methods.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, multimodal information, scene graphs, multimodal knowledge graph, spectral clustering

Summary: 
MMGraphRAG addresses the limitation of conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods by refining visual content through scene graphs and constructing a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG). By employing spectral clustering for cross-modal entity linking and retrieving context along reasoning paths, MMGraphRAG enhances the generative process. This approach not only captures the structure of knowledge and logical chains between modalities but also demonstrates strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths. Experimental results on DocBench and MMLongBench datasets show that MMGraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in terms of generalizing ability and performance in specific tasks. MMGraphRAG offers a promising solution for leveraging multimodal information and improving the effectiveness of language model generation with external knowledge bases.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However, conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information. Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets, demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

<div> Algorithm, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, Offline Policy, Sampling-based, Policy Graph 

Summary: 

The article introduces a new algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo graph search (POMCGS), designed to solve large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) offline. Unlike many online methods, POMCGS constructs a policy graph by folding the search tree on the fly, reducing computations and allowing for prior analysis of the policy. The algorithm also incorporates action progressive widening and observation clustering methods to address continuous POMDPs. Experimental results demonstrate that POMCGS can compute policies for challenging POMDPs previously unsolvable by offline algorithms and achieve competitive values compared to state-of-the-art online methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing (Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it. Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

<div> neural networks, reasoning limitations, logic predicates, logical expressiveness, language models 
Summary:
The study introduces a formal model to understand the constraints on reasoning abilities in large neural networks used in natural language processing. By representing neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space, the researchers demonstrate that each layer can only encode one additional level of logical reasoning. This limitation results in the inability of networks of a certain depth to accurately represent predicates in a higher-order logic. The framework explains issues such as hallucination, repetition, and limited planning in language models. The structure of neural networks creates a null space during tokenization and embedding, prohibiting the representation of higher-order predicates. The findings suggest the need for architectural improvements and interpretability strategies in developing future language models. <div>
arXiv:2507.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness. This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination, repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in future development of language models.

<div> implementable framework, corrigibility, provable guarantees, multi-step environments, partially observed <br />
Summary: This paper introduces an implementable framework for corrigibility in complex, partially observed environments. It proposes a novel approach with five structurally separate utility heads that prioritize deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior, and bounded task reward. The framework guarantees exact single-round corrigibility in the off-switch game and extends this to multi-step, self-spawning agents. By ensuring that safety properties are not violated even if each utility head is learned to a certain error margin, the framework maintains net human benefit. In contrast to existing approaches, which merge norms into a single scalar, this framework separates norms to prioritize obedience and impact-limits. The paper also discusses the undecidability of determining post-hack agent corrigibility and proposes a finite-horizon "decidable island" for safety certification. Overall, the framework provides clear implementation guidance for current and future autonomous systems by mitigating reward-hacking risks through evaluation quality rather than hidden incentives. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

Summary: <br />
Hallucinations in large language model (LLM)-based agents can have serious consequences, but existing evaluations lack a unified testbed. This paper introduces MIRAGE-Bench, a benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. A three-part taxonomy addresses agentic hallucinations, including actions unfaithful to task instructions, execution history, or environment observations. Test cases are systematically elicited and synthesized using a snapshot strategy to analyze agent failures. Evaluation of hallucination behaviors is done through a fine-grained LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts. MIRAGE-Bench provides insights on failure modes of LLM agents and aims to progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

The proposed approach enhances the incremental solving method by incorporating smart expansion functions that add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration.

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming (ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space, thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

Summary:
GenoMAS introduces a team of LLM-based scientists for gene expression analysis, combining structured workflows and autonomous agents. This approach utilizes typed message-passing protocols and a guided-planning framework to handle complex genomic data. With a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification on the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS outperforms previous methods. It effectively identifies biologically relevant gene-phenotype associations while accounting for confounders. The code for GenoMAS is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2507.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research. However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally, we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient and efficient deployment strategies.

<title>The Architecture of Cognitive Amplification: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding as a Resolution to the Comfort-Growth Paradox in Human-AI Cognitive Integration</title>

Abstract: AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and creativity - they present a fundamental "comfort-growth paradox": AI's user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1) Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity. Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and continuous learning.

Abstract: We investigate creativity that is underlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to present design considerations for Computational Creativity (CC) systems. We find this declaration to describe creativity in salient aspects and bring to light creativity as a Human Right attributed to the Fourth Generation of such rights. This generation of rights attributes CC systems and the evolving nature of interaction with entities of shared intelligence. Our methodology examines five of thirty articles from the UDHR and demonstrates each article with actualizations concluding with design considerations for each. We contribute our findings to ground the relationship between creativity and CC systems.

Abstract: Scalable oversight protocols aim to empower evaluators to accurately verify AI models more capable than themselves. However, human evaluators are subject to biases that can lead to systematic errors. We conduct two studies examining the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the model is "correct most of the time, but not all of the time". We find no overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers are incorrect. We also reanalyze data from prior work that was more optimistic about simple protocols, finding that human evaluators possessing knowledge absent from models likely contributed to their positive results--an advantage that diminishes as models continue to scale in capability. These findings underscore the importance of testing the degree to which oversight protocols are robust to evaluator biases, whether they outperform simple deference to the model under evaluation, and whether their performance scales with increasing problem difficulty and model capability.

<title>Does AI and Human Advice Mitigate Punishment for Selfish Behavior? An Experiment on AI ethics From a Psychological Perspective</title>

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii) encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice source does not.

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11 plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV, DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B - 26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation: https://github.com/SD122025/ChartGen/

Abstract: Generative agents have made significant progress in simulating human behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term, medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions, needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence, one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

Abstract: As AI art generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, HCI research has focused primarily on questions of detection, authenticity, and automation. This paper argues that such approaches fundamentally misunderstand how artistic value emerges from the concerns that drive human image production. Through examination of historical precedents, we demonstrate that artistic style is not only visual appearance but the resolution of creative struggle, as artists wrestle with influence and technical constraints to develop unique ways of seeing. Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible patterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies not only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the origins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual traces. This reframing suggests new technical directions for HCI research in generative AI, focused on automatic documentation of stylistic lineage and creative choice rather than simple reproduction of aesthetic effects.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for tailored healthcare communication but face challenges in interpretability and multi-task integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text and image-based inquiries related to myopia. To achieve this, ChatMyopia integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to myopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a randomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing patient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare practitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as a valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction with medical services in primary eye care settings.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to create psychological spaciousness in society. Spaciousness is defined as the ability to hold diverse interpersonal interactions and forms the basis for vulnerability that leads to authenticity that leads to prosocial behaviors and thus to societal harmony. This paper demonstrates an attempt to quantify, the human conditioning to subconsciously modify authentic self-expression to fit the norms of the dominant culture. Gaze is explored across various marginalized and intersectional groups, using concepts from postmodern philosophy and psychology. The effects of gaze are studied through analyzing a few redacted Reddit posts, only to be discussed in discourse and not endorsement. A mathematical formulation for the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite Metric is presented to model the analysis of two sets of conversational spaces in relation to one another. The outcome includes an equation to train Large Language Models (LLMs) - the working mechanism of AI products such as Chat-GPT; and an argument for affirming and inclusive HCI, based on the equation, is presented. The argument is supported by a few principles of Neuro-plasticity, The brain's lifelong capacity to rewire.

<title>Beyond 9-to-5: A Generative Model for Augmenting Mobility Data of Underrepresented Shift Workers</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation planning.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g., the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM, with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts (resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99. Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation (EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices, which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit. Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data. Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering the available data across a population of structures. However, differences between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL), can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions. Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure. Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper, knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only 5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning (ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields, capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for each model.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs) such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/blob/main/OpenBio/ATGC_Gen).

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents promising opportunities for automation and enhancement in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). However, comprehensively evaluating these models in circuit design remains challenging due to the narrow scope of existing benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMCircuitEval, the first multimodal benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLM performance comprehensively across diverse EDA tasks. MMCircuitEval comprises 3614 meticulously curated question-answer (QA) pairs spanning digital and analog circuits across critical EDA stages - ranging from general knowledge and specifications to front-end and back-end design. Derived from textbooks, technical question banks, datasheets, and real-world documentation, each QA pair undergoes rigorous expert review for accuracy and relevance. Our benchmark uniquely categorizes questions by design stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning, computation), and difficulty level, enabling detailed analysis of model capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and complex computations, highlighting the critical need for targeted training datasets and modeling approaches. MMCircuitEval provides a foundational resource for advancing MLLMs in EDA, facilitating their integration into real-world circuit design workflows. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/cure-lab/MMCircuitEval.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats, requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover, these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data, which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with LLMs.

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation, Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce, with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions. Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI), which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical operational benchmarks.

<title>Clinical-Grade Blood Pressure Prediction in ICU Settings: An Ensemble Framework with Uncertainty Quantification and Cross-Institutional Validation</title>

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs) where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

<title>FedDPG: An Adaptive Yet Efficient Prompt-tuning Approach in Federated Learning Settings</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead. Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning (FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator (FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings. Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL network.

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design. Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and beyond with artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the $\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

<title>Justifications for Democratizing AI Alignment and Their Prospects</title>

Abstract: The AI alignment problem comprises both technical and normative dimensions. While technical solutions focus on implementing normative constraints in AI systems, the normative problem concerns determining what these constraints should be. This paper examines justifications for democratic approaches to the normative problem -- where affected stakeholders determine AI alignment -- as opposed to epistocratic approaches that defer to normative experts. We analyze both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent illegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative uncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill through political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify significant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the prevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests that neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be sufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert judgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI monopolization.

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code. While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in discrete action spaces by eliminating value function dependencies through group-based advantage estimation. However, its application to continuous control remains unexplored, limiting its utility in robotics where continuous actions are essential. This paper presents a theoretical framework extending GRPO to continuous control environments, addressing challenges in high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and temporal dynamics. Our approach introduces trajectory-based policy clustering, state-aware advantage estimation, and regularized policy updates designed for robotic applications. We provide theoretical analysis of convergence properties and computational complexity, establishing a foundation for future empirical validation in robotic systems including locomotion and manipulation tasks.

<title>PEMUTA: Pedagogically-Enriched Multi-Granular Undergraduate Thesis Assessment</title>

Abstract: The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence, they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR), followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie, few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations.

Abstract: The growth of machine learning (ML) models and associated datasets triggers a consequent dramatic increase in energy costs for the use and training of these models. In the current context of environmental awareness and global sustainability concerns involving ICT, Green AI is becoming an important research topic. Initiatives like the AI Energy Score Ratings are a good example. Nevertheless, these benchmarking attempts are still to be integrated with existing work on Quality Models and Service-Level Agreements common in other, more mature, ICT subfields. This limits the (automatic) analysis of this model energy descriptions and their use in (semi)automatic model comparison, selection, and certification processes. We aim to leverage the concept of quality models and merge it with existing ML model reporting initiatives and Green/Frugal AI proposals to formalize a Sustainable Quality Model for AI/ML models. As a first step, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language to precisely define the sustainability aspects of an ML model (including the energy costs for its different tasks). This information can then be exported as an extended version of the well-known Model Cards initiative while, at the same time, being formal enough to be input of any other model description automatic process.

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation, explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset, achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a significant improvement in functional correctness.

Abstract: The medical ecosystem consists of the training of new clinicians and researchers, the practice of clinical medicine, and areas of adjacent research. There are many aspects of these domains that could benefit from the application of task automation and programmatic assistance. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, including large language models (LLMs), have been promised to deliver on healthcare innovation, improving care speed and accuracy, and reducing the burden on staff for manual interventions. However, LLMs have no understanding of objective truth that is based in reality. They also represent real risks to the disclosure of protected information when used by clinicians and researchers. The use of AI in medicine in general, and the deployment of LLMs in particular, therefore requires careful consideration and thoughtful application to reap the benefits of these technologies while avoiding the dangers in each context.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery, but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments. They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans. Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences, limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities, challenges, and roadmaps for their realization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However, LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across 20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge. Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns, block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and efficient language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks, where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open- and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any additional supervision.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO) paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that adaptive multi-qubit observables can enable practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities--speech, vision, and text--and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.

<title>Efficient and Scalable Agentic AI with Heterogeneous Systems</title>

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage, we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic orchestration system that can place the granular components across a heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed infrastructure.

Abstract: Understanding clients' thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability. Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation, we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding of client's beliefs and thoughts.

Abstract: We study the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs) and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth, diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments, solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable, high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information, rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications, including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility, reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal, ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive, context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications, LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs. Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

<title>Efficient Learning for Product Attributes with Compact Multimodal Models</title>

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets. Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human, adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking, Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and 99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However, significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains an important direction for future work.

Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies, and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

<title>Quaternion-Based Robust PCA for Efficient Moving Target Detection and Background Recovery in Color Videos</title>

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1 quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA) framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Ruchtech/uQRPCA

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc. However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities. This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor. Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\% improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DisasterMobLLM.

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing, privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices. To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen. Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover, existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of 24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a 1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

Abstract: Bladder cancer claims one life every 3 minutes worldwide. Most patients are diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), yet up to 70% recur after treatment, triggering a relentless cycle of surgeries, monitoring, and risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour count, surgeon experience, and hospital stay - offering accuracy and full transparency. This makes TM a powerful, trustworthy decision-support tool ready for real-world adoption.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However, their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the target system.

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%. Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of creative applications.

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text, bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences, followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR. By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to 6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises must adapt their organisational structures and operations. This organisational shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations. The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders and actors who participate in the BP design.

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market (LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

<title>RaGS: Unleashing 3D Gaussian Splatting from 4D Radar and Monocular Cues for 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to secure this emerging ecosystem.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R, the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for autonomous driving under federated learning

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection (OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like $\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for multimodal transformers.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a ``black box'', hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors, evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis, and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability. This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication (IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code. CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using 156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/crosspl-2814.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks (i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder, Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking performance of various models due to different data distributions and overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures. However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by fine-tuning deep networks.

Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders cultivation.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover, sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper), text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio (Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of encoding models to novel movie stimuli.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images, eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases that often demand urgent care.

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions, plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates. Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired, first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks, environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex, high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... . The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's performance on a real robot.

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%, and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current recommendation systems.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings.
  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes, for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts, including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters, and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices, integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.
  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The need for building legal text processing applications for different natural languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Abstract: Precise fare prediction is crucial in ride-hailing platforms and urban mobility systems. This study examines three machine learning models-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), XGBoost, and TimesNet to evaluate their predictive capabilities for taxi fares using a real-world dataset comprising over 55 million records. Both raw (noisy) and denoised versions of the dataset are analyzed to assess the impact of data quality on model performance. The study evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy, calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and feature sensitivity. We also explore pre-processing strategies, including KNN imputation, Gaussian noise injection, and autoencoder-based denoising. The study reveals critical differences between classical and deep learning models under realistic conditions, offering practical guidelines for building robust and scalable models in urban fare prediction systems.

Abstract: As AI-driven dataspaces become integral to data sharing and collaborative analytics, ensuring privacy, performance, and policy compliance presents significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation, alongside strategies for aligning AI with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act. We propose a novel taxonomy to classify these techniques based on privacy levels, performance impacts, and compliance complexity, offering a clear framework for practitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics -- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory fragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework for policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized benchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and Eclipse EDC. By synthesizing technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives, this work lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy, efficient, and compliant AI systems in dataspaces, fostering innovation in secure and responsible data-driven ecosystems.

<title>FedSWA: Improving Generalization in Federated Learning with Highly Heterogeneous Data via Momentum-Based Stochastic Controlled Weight Averaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called \texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral 7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

<title>Anomaly Detection in Human Language via Meta-Learning: A Few-Shot Approach</title>

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19 fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000 validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines. Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k\!-\!1$) times for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce Irredundant $k$--fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent performance estimates across diverse datasets --comparable to $k$--fold cross-validation-- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall computational cost.

<title>FaRMamba: Frequency-based learning and Reconstruction aided Mamba for Medical Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20056</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation (2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM) restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic, diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models, rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper, we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics, offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys. Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses, scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while consuming significantly less energy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&amp;D) enables models to explore superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&amp;D strategies. Our work provides both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM, a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts, addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English) and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU, METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of cultural preservation.

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions.

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view, multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models, featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a wide range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and have been applied across various domains in physical science. However, their performance often relies on large-scale labeled training data. While existing pretraining strategies can improve model performance, they often suffer from a mismatch between the objectives of pretraining and downstream tasks or rely on extensive labeled datasets and increasingly complex architectures to achieve broad generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Pretraining for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP), a framework designed to iteratively improve the predictive performance of MLIP models. IPIP incorporates a forgetting mechanism to prevent iterative training from converging to suboptimal local minima. Unlike general-purpose foundation models, which frequently underperform on specialized tasks due to a trade-off between generality and system-specific accuracy, IPIP achieves higher accuracy and efficiency using lightweight architectures. Compared to general-purpose force fields, this approach achieves over 80% reduction in prediction error and up to 4x speedup in the challenging Mo-S-O system, enabling fast and accurate simulations.

<title>Aggregation-aware MLP: An Unsupervised Approach for Graph Message-passing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20127</link>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms. However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity, especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

<title>Sem-DPO: Mitigating Semantic Inconsistency in Preference Optimization for Prompt Engineering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20133</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language models.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/KDD-Cup-2025-Meta-CRAG-MM .

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy, research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper, we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems. To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices, assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers, effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for other speakers.

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation, which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have shown that our generated English and Arabic questions (\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in https://github.com/wangk0b/Multi_Agentic_QA_Long_Doc.git. Sample Question and Answer (QA) pairs and structured system prompts can be found in the Appendix.

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking (UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

<title>Trust the Model: Compact VLMs as In-Context Judges for Image-Text Data Quality</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment. Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\ \textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model, training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely available at https://github.com/daulettoibazar/Compact_VLM_Filter.

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs, and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both 2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network design.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex, large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm, inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts, scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and optimization.

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on https://github.com/kong13661/LRR-Bench.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments.

<title>Partial Domain Adaptation via Importance Sampling-based Shift Correction</title>

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However, the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset. We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8% mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules, paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification (benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones - EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 - are each adapted with a custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference. Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2), Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at https://github.com/BruthYU/protein-se3.

<title>Post-Completion Learning for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence (}) token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.

<title>Learning from Expert Factors: Trajectory-level Reward Shaping for Formulaic Alpha Mining</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Abstract: Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have recently gained attention as a promising computing model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials, while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing the tuning process for CIMs.

<title>A Comparative Study of OpenMP Scheduling Algorithm Selection Strategies</title>

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex, with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role. Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

<title>MIPS: a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence Pre-training Framework for Polymer Property Prediction</title>

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application. However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer, since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study, we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling. From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM) and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA). Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking" strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures, a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL) test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However, standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness, student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness, Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: The canonical theory of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, founded on sub-additivity, is insensitive to non-convex uncertainty structures, leading to an identifiability impasse. This paper develops a mathematical framework for an identifiable calculus sensitive to non-convex geometry. We introduce the $\theta$-BSDE, a class of backward stochastic differential equations where the driver is determined by a pointwise maximization over a primitive, possibly non-convex, uncertainty set. The system's tractability is predicated not on convexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and globally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this hypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish well-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically regular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under non-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique along any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify the fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global regularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator defines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection to fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples, allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to existing clustering techniques.

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical networks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the process.

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and 0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of 0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2% and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse genomic contexts.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer, leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories. Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior, and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers, Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and efficiency in GNN inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts. However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law, users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

<title>DmC: Nearest Neighbor Guidance Diffusion Model for Offline Cross-domain Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control, this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead, the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity. Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability, adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and practicality compared to vision-language models.

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks, inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies, and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to generate a fictional Buddhist "sutr"', and offers a detailed analysis of the resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making. We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to adapt.

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.

<title>T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/T2I-Copilot.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However, previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages: 1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and 2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e., Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D facial animation.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Abstract: 3D photoacoustic tomography (3D-PAT) using high-frequency hemispherical transducers offers near-omnidirectional reception and enhanced sensitivity to the finer structural details encoded in the high-frequency components of the broadband photoacoustic (PA) signal. However, practical constraints such as limited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in sparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we revisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA radio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into the DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed band-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training data, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical absorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is designed to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model was evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom and in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed training mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the different tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the spatiotemporal bandwidth. Qualitatively, the sine-activated model uniquely enhanced high-frequency content that produces clearer vascular structure with fewer artefacts. Quantitatively, the sine-activated model exhibits full bandwidth at -12 dB spectrum and significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio with minimal loss of structural similarity index. Lastly, we optimized our approach to enable fast enhanced 3D-PAT at 2 volumes-per-second for better practical imaging of a free-moving targets.

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5 over selected baselines.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size. Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high classification accuracy.

Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user expectations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens, motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy. However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP) risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving 100\% verification accuracy.

<title>MIMII-Agent: Leveraging LLMs with Function Calling for Relative Evaluation of Anomalous Sound Detection</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection (UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics. However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder. The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs, numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently, the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824 numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value. This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance (F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework. Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data incompleteness.

<title>Regularizing Subspace Redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation. Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy constraints to the feature distributions across different projections. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Lucenova/ReSoRA.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold level and re- set mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss, while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Abstract: In e-commerce recommender and search systems, tree-based models, such as LambdaMART, have set a strong baseline for Learning-to-Rank (LTR) tasks. Despite their effectiveness and widespread adoption in industry, the debate continues whether deep neural networks (DNNs) can outperform traditional tree-based models in this domain. To contribute to this discussion, we systematically benchmark DNNs against our production-grade LambdaMART model. We evaluate multiple DNN architectures and loss functions on a proprietary dataset from OTTO and validate our findings through an 8-week online A/B test. The results show that a simple DNN architecture outperforms a strong tree-based baseline in terms of total clicks and revenue, while achieving parity in total units sold.

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources. Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth) and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from various everyday containers.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen, using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic data.

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis). We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods. Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that, under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse representations.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets, robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves $92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However, these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control. To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset, eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in terms of the music-specific attributes.

Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems, and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed* preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency. Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies, and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

<title>SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology</title>

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.

<title>HAMLET-FFD: Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning Embeddings Transformation for Face Forgery Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains 32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii) Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with 14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

<title>Modeling User Behavior from Adaptive Surveys with Supplemental Context</title>

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN (Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis. LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior modeling in survey-centric applications.

<title>Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks (EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask 1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks. SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles, can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/pegasi-ai/fine-grained-editting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.

<title>Multivariate Conformal Prediction via Conformalized Gaussian Scoring</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is unattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the promise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional guarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining conditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing heteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density $\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this vein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly, typically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling, we observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the case of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly conformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a number of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how to construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets as partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal sets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results indicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely approximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to alternative methods.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings, we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and even maintains or improves quality.

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

<title>Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL</title>

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.

<title>From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive eval- uation frameworks that assess both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for region- specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1), comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities across 2 million video samples, and an evalua- tion protocol for assessing joint audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data. Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate 'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

arXiv:2507.20994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models (LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii) general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs, thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

arXiv:2507.20997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where both performance and accountability are paramount.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework to extract the algebra of the transformations of worlds from the perspective of an agent. As a starting point, we use our framework to reproduce the symmetry-based representations from the symmetry-based disentangled representation learning (SBDRL) formalism proposed by [1]; only the algebra of transformations of worlds that form groups can be described using symmetry-based representations. We then study the algebras of the transformations of worlds with features that occur in simple reinforcement learning scenarios. Using computational methods, that we developed, we extract the algebras of the transformations of these worlds and classify them according to their properties. Finally, we generalise two important results of SBDRL - the equivariance condition and the disentangling definition - from only working with symmetry-based representations to working with representations capturing the transformation properties of worlds with transformations for any algebra. Finally, we combine our generalised equivariance condition and our generalised disentangling definition to show that disentangled sub-algebras can each have their own individual equivariance conditions, which can be treated independently.

Abstract: Algorithmic decisions in critical domains such as hiring, college admissions, and lending are often based on rankings. Given the impact of these decisions on individuals, organizations, and population groups, it is essential to understand them - to help individuals improve their ranking position, design better ranking procedures, and ensure legal compliance. In this paper, we argue that explainability methods for classification and regression, such as SHAP, are insufficient for ranking tasks, and present ShaRP - Shapley Values for Rankings and Preferences - a framework that explains the contributions of features to various aspects of a ranked outcome.
  ShaRP computes feature contributions for various ranking-specific profit functions, such as rank and top-k, and also includes a novel Shapley value-based method for explaining pairwise preference outcomes. We provide a flexible implementation of ShaRP, capable of efficiently and comprehensively explaining ranked and pairwise outcomes over tabular data, in score-based ranking and learning-to-rank tasks. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation methodology for ranking explainability methods, showing through qualitative, quantitative, and usability studies that our rank-aware QoIs offer complementary insights, scale effectively, and help users interpret ranked outcomes in practice.

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods learn geometric representations of entities and relations to predict plausible missing knowledge. These representations are typically assumed to capture rule-like inference patterns. However, our theoretical understanding of which inference patterns can be captured remains limited. Ideally, KG embedding methods should be expressive enough such that for any set of rules, there exist relation embeddings that exactly capture these rules. This principle has been studied within the framework of region-based embeddings, but existing models are severely limited in the kinds of rule bases that can be captured. We argue that this stems from the fact that entity embeddings are only compared in a coordinate-wise fashion. As an alternative, we propose RESHUFFLE, a simple model based on ordering constraints that can faithfully capture a much larger class of rule bases than existing approaches. Most notably, RESHUFFLE can capture bounded inference w.r.t. arbitrary sets of closed path rules. The entity embeddings in our framework can be learned by a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which effectively acts as a differentiable rule base.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems batch concurrent user requests to achieve efficient serving. However, in real-world deployments, such inter-request parallelism from batching is often limited by external factors such as low request rates or memory constraints. Recent works focus on intra-request parallelism from speculative decoding as a solution to this problem. Unfortunately, benefits from intra-request parallelism are often fragile, as speculative decoding causes overhead, and speculated tokens may miss. We observe that speculative decoding may degrade LLM serving performance if added naively without tuning to the incoming requests and the speculation method. To alleviate the need for expert tuning and make speculative decoding more robust, we present TurboSpec, a speculation control system that automatically profiles the execution environment and utilizes a feedback-based algorithm to dynamically adjust the amount of intra-request parallelism in LLM serving. TurboSpec predicts "goodput" - the amount of successfully generated tokens - to evaluate and adjust intra-request parallelism amount to that with the highest goodput in runtime. We implement TurboSpec on a real-world LLM serving system vLLM and demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse workloads and hardware configurations, providing consistent performance improvements across all test scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents LLM2TEA, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm, representing the first agentic AI designer of its kind operating with generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM). LLM2TEA enables the crossbreeding of solutions from multiple domains, fostering novel solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Of particular interest is the ability to discover designs that are both novel and conforming to real-world physical specifications. LLM2TEA comprises an LLM to generate genotype samples from text prompts describing target objects, a text-to-3D generative model to produce corresponding phenotypes, a classifier to interpret its semantic representations, and a computational simulator to assess its physical properties. Novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators are introduced to guide the search towards high-performing, practically viable designs. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, showing 97% to 174% improvements in the diversity of novel designs over the current text-to-3D baseline. Moreover, over 73% of the generated designs outperform the top 1% of designs produced by the text-to-3D baseline in terms of physical performance. The designs produced by LLM2TEA are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world contexts. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D printed, demonstrating the ability of our approach to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible, physical designs. These designs underscore the potential of LLM2TEA as a powerful tool for complex design optimization and discovery, capable of producing novel and physically viable designs.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), such as GPT-4o, have recently unlocked audio dialogue capabilities, enabling direct spoken exchanges with humans. The potential of LALMs broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding Benchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, e.g., "Really!?" with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments on 16 LALMs, our analysis reveals that existing LALMs struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones. The benchmark is available at https://adu-bench.github.io/.

Abstract: Early in development, infants learn a range of useful concepts, which can be challenging from a computational standpoint. This early learning comes together with an initial understanding of aspects of the meaning of concepts, e.g., their implications, causality, and using them to predict likely future events. All this is accomplished in many cases with little or no supervision, and from relatively few examples, compared with current network models. In learning about objects and human-object interactions, early acquired and possibly innate concepts are often used in the process of learning additional, more complex concepts. In the current work, we model how early-acquired concepts are used in the learning of subsequent concepts, and compare the results with standard deep network modeling. We focused in particular on the use of the concepts of animacy and goal attribution in learning to predict future events. We show that the use of early concepts in the learning of new concepts leads to better learning (higher accuracy) and more efficient learning (requiring less data). We further show that this integration of early and new concepts shapes the representation of the concepts acquired by the model. The results show that when the concepts were learned in a human-like manner, the emerging representation was more useful, as measured in terms of generalization to novel data and tasks. On a more general level, the results suggest that there are likely to be basic differences in the conceptual structures acquired by current network models compared to human learning.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback e.g. "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own" into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address two key challenges in applying deep learning to graph-structured data: they handle varying size input graphs and ensure invariance under graph isomorphism. While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated with autonomous agents hold significant potential for advancing scientific discovery through automated reasoning and task execution. However, applying LLM agents to drug discovery is still constrained by challenges such as large-scale multimodal data processing, limited task automation, and poor support for domain-specific tools. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DrugPilot, a LLM-based agent system with a parameterized reasoning architecture designed for end-to-end scientific workflows in drug discovery. DrugPilot enables multi-stage research processes by integrating structured tool use with a novel parameterized memory pool. The memory pool converts heterogeneous data from both public sources and user-defined inputs into standardized representations. This design supports efficient multi-turn dialogue, reduces information loss during data exchange, and enhances complex scientific decision-making. To support training and benchmarking, we construct a drug instruction dataset covering eight core drug discovery tasks. Under the Berkeley function-calling benchmark, DrugPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agents such as ReAct and LoT, achieving task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% for simple, multi-tool, and multi-turn scenarios, respectively. These results highlight DrugPilot's potential as a versatile agent framework for computational science domains requiring automated, interactive, and data-integrated reasoning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for guaranteeing and evaluating the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in control systems. We introduce "recovery time" as a new metric of resilience in order to quantify the time required for an LSTM to return to its normal state after anomalous inputs. By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications.

Abstract: Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct, Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race, gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation (AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking separately for the answer. Experiments on the MMLU and GPQA datasets spanning subjects and difficulty show that this separation of tasks significantly reduces overconfidence and delivers more human-like sensitivity to task difficulty.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important, and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents, while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key research directions, including the development of simulation environments for testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation within multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus, and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL, enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-in, fly-in, and wipe, are critical for audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually created test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts.

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a novel contrastive RL algorithm.
  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x3.12 on L40, x2.50 on RTX 3090, x2.39 on H100, and x2.37 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources. We also identify important challenges posed by training RL models for tasks like CUDA development, where RL often learns to exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than solve the intended optimization problems. By identifying these failure modes and analyzing their root causes, we develop practical methods for creating more robust training procedures that prevent reward hacking.

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Advancements in large pre-trained generative models have expanded their potential as effective data generators in visual recognition. This work delves into the impact of generative images, primarily comparing paradigms that harness external data (\ie generative \vs retrieval \vs original).
  Our key contributions are: \textbf{1) GenBench Construction:} We devise \textbf{GenBench}, a broad benchmark comprising 22 datasets with 2548 categories, to appraise generative data across various visual recognition tasks. \textbf{2) CLER Score:} To address the insufficient correlation of existing metrics (\eg, FID, CLIP score) with downstream recognition performance, we propose \textbf{CLER}, a training-free metric indicating generative data's efficiency for recognition tasks prior to training. \textbf{3) New Baselines:} Comparisons of generative data with retrieved data from the same external pool help to elucidate the unique traits of generative data. \textbf{4) External Knowledge Injection:} By fine-tuning special token embeddings for each category via Textual Inversion, performance improves across 17 datasets, except when dealing with low-resolution reference images.
  Our exhaustive benchmark and analysis spotlight generative data's promise in visual recognition, while identifying key challenges for future investigation.

Abstract: In this paper, we approach the problem of cost (loss) minimization in underparametrized shallow ReLU networks through the explicit construction of upper bounds which appeal to the structure of classification data, without use of gradient descent. A key focus is on elucidating the geometric structure of approximate and precise minimizers. We consider an $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost function, input space $\mathbb{R}^M$, output space ${\mathbb R}^Q$ with $Q\leq M$, and training input sample size that can be arbitrarily large. We prove an upper bound on the minimum of the cost function of order $O(\delta_P)$ where $\delta_P$ measures the signal-to-noise ratio of training data. In the special case $M=Q$, we explicitly determine an exact degenerate local minimum of the cost function, and show that the sharp value differs from the upper bound obtained for $Q\leq M$ by a relative error $O(\delta_P^2)$. The proof of the upper bound yields a constructively trained network; we show that it metrizes a particular $Q$-dimensional subspace in the input space ${\mathbb R}^M$. We comment on the characterization of the global minimum of the cost function in the given context.

<title>Point Cloud Self-supervised Learning via 3D to Multi-view Masked Learner</title>

arXiv:2311.10887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multi-modal masked autoencoders (MAE) has been introduced in 3D self-supervised learning, offering enhanced feature learning by leveraging both 2D and 3D data to capture richer cross-modal representations. However, these approaches have two limitations: (1) they inefficiently require both 2D and 3D modalities as inputs, even though the inherent multi-view properties of 3D point clouds already contain 2D modality. (2) input 2D modality causes the reconstruction learning to unnecessarily rely on visible 2D information, hindering 3D geometric representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D to Multi-View Learner (Multi-View ML) that only utilizes 3D modalities as inputs and effectively capture rich spatial information in 3D point clouds. Specifically, we first project 3D point clouds to multi-view 2D images at the feature level based on 3D-based pose. Then, we introduce two components: (1) a 3D to multi-view autoencoder that reconstructs point clouds and multi-view images from 3D and projected 2D features; (2) a multi-scale multi-head (MSMH) attention mechanism that facilitates local-global information interactions in each decoder transformer block through attention heads at various scales. Additionally, a novel two-stage self-training strategy is proposed to align 2D and 3D representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts across various downstream tasks, including 3D classification, part segmentation, and object detection.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to harness labeled source data to train models for unlabeled target data. Despite extensive research in domains like computer vision and natural language processing, UDA remains underexplored for time series data, which has widespread real-world applications ranging from medicine and manufacturing to earth observation and human activity recognition. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating UDA techniques for time series classification, with a focus on deep learning methods. We provide seven new benchmark datasets covering various domain shifts and temporal dynamics, facilitating fair and standardized UDA method assessments with state of the art neural network backbones (e.g. Inception) for time series data. This benchmark offers insights into the strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches while preserving the unsupervised nature of domain adaptation, making it directly applicable to practical problems. Our paper serves as a vital resource for researchers and practitioners, advancing domain adaptation solutions for time series data and fostering innovation in this critical field. The implementation code of this benchmark is available at https://github.com/EricssonResearch/UDA-4-TSC.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems often require agents to collaborate with or compete against other agents with diverse goals, behaviors, or strategies. Agent modeling is essential when designing adaptive policies for intelligent machine agents in multiagent systems, as this is the means by which the ego agent understands other agents' behavior and extracts their meaningful policy representations. These representations can be used to enhance the ego agent's adaptive policy which is trained by reinforcement learning. However, existing agent modeling approaches typically assume the availability of local observations from other agents (modeled agents) during training or a long observation trajectory for policy adaption. To remove these constrictive assumptions and improve agent modeling performance, we devised a Contrastive Learning-based Agent Modeling (CLAM) method that relies only on the local observations from the ego agent during training and execution. With these observations, CLAM is capable of generating consistent high-quality policy representations in real-time right from the beginning of each episode. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on both cooperative and competitive tasks, highlighting the potential of contrastive learning-based agent modeling for enhancing reinforcement learning.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Testing-Time Optimization for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose estimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited generalization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\% on Human3.6M.

Abstract: Many animal species can approximately judge the number of objects in a visual scene at a single glance, and humans can further determine the exact cardinality of a set by deploying systematic counting procedures. In contrast, it has been observed that even state-of-the-art AI systems have very limited enumeration skills. In this work, we propose two benchmark tasks inspired by cognitive science that allow to precisely evaluate the visual enumeration capabilities of multimodal foundation models, thereby providing an objective measure of their number sense and counting level. We consider popular visual question answering models (BLIP, LLaVA and ViLT) as well as advanced image-to-text (Gemini, GPT and Qwen) and text-to-image (DALL-E, FLUX and Stable Diffusion) AI systems. Our analyses show that even the most advanced models cannot reliably name the number of objects in simple visual stimuli or generate images containing a target number of items, as indexed by their low accuracy in both types of tasks. Especially for numbers outside the subitizing range, their responses are often far from the target numerosity, and, in stark contrast with human behavior, in many cases the distribution of errors depends on the object category. We also observe some striking mistakes with small numbers. Our findings demonstrate that developing an intuitive visual understanding of number remains challenging for AI models and that merely increasing model size might not be a viable strategy to promote the emergence of systematic counting skills. We release the full code of our benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of enumeration skills in future AI systems.

<title>The Effect of Data Poisoning on Counterfactual Explanations</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are a widely used approach for examining the predictions of black-box systems. They can offer the opportunity for computational recourse by suggesting actionable changes on how to alter the input to obtain a different (i.e., more favorable) system output. However, recent studies have pointed out their susceptibility to various forms of manipulation.
  This work studies the vulnerability of counterfactual explanations to data poisoning. We formally introduce and investigate data poisoning in the context of counterfactual explanations for increasing the cost of recourse on three different levels: locally for a single instance, a sub-group of instances, or globally for all instances. In this context, we formally introduce and characterize data poisonings, from which we derive and investigate a general data poisoning mechanism. We demonstrate the impact of such data poisoning in the critical real-world application of explaining event detections in water distribution networks. Additionally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating that state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods and toolboxes are vulnerable to such data poisoning. Furthermore, we find that existing defense methods fail to detect those poisonous samples.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often exhibit sub-optimal performance under covariate and category shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) presents a promising solution to this dilemma, yet most SFDA approaches are restricted to closed-set scenarios. In this paper, we explore Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) aiming to accurately classify "known" data belonging to common categories and segregate them from target-private "unknown" data. We propose a novel Global and Local Clustering (GLC) technique, which comprises an adaptive one-vs-all global clustering algorithm to discern between target classes, complemented by a local k-NN clustering strategy to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the effectiveness, the inherent closed-set source architecture leads to uniform treatment of "unknown" data, impeding the identification of distinct "unknown" categories. To address this, we evolve GLC to GLC++, integrating a contrastive affinity learning strategy. We examine the superiority of GLC and GLC++ across multiple benchmarks and category shift scenarios. Remarkably, in the most challenging open-partial-set scenarios, GLC and GLC++ surpass GATE by 16.8\% and 18.9\% in H-score on VisDA, respectively. GLC++ enhances the novel category clustering accuracy of GLC by 4.1\% in open-set scenarios on Office-Home. Furthermore, the introduced contrastive learning strategy not only enhances GLC but also significantly facilitates existing methodologies.

Abstract: The high compute cost associated with pretraining large language models limits their research. Two strategies have emerged to address this issue: domain specialization and pretraining with high-quality data. To explore these strategies, we specialized the Mistral-7B model with 1.9 billion unique tokens from reputable Brazilian legal sources and conducted few-shot evaluations on legal and general knowledge test suites. Our model, Juru, demonstrates the benefits of domain specialization by achieving improved performance on legal benchmarks, even with a reduced amount of pretraining data. However, this domain specialization through continued pretraining comes at the cost of increased forgetting in unrelated domains, as evidenced by performance degradation on general knowledge test suites in both Portuguese and English. This study contributes to the growing body of scientific evidence showing that pretraining data selection may enhance the performance of large language models, enabling the exploration of these models at a lower cost. Juru is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/roseval/Juru-7B .

arXiv:2404.15678v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), optimized through human feedback, have rapidly emerged as a leading paradigm for developing intelligent conversational assistants. However, despite their strong performance across many benchmarks, LLM-based agents might still lack conversational skills such as disambiguation -- when they are faced with ambiguity, they often overhedge or implicitly guess users' true intents rather than asking clarification questions. Under task-specific settings, high-quality conversation samples are often limited, constituting a bottleneck for LLMs' ability to learn optimal dialogue action policies. We propose Action-Based Contrastive Self-Training (ACT), a quasi-online preference optimization algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), that enables data-efficient dialogue policy learning in multi-turn conversation modeling. We demonstrate ACT's efficacy under in data-efficient tuning scenarios, even when there is no action label available, using multiple real-world conversational tasks: tabular-grounded question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and AmbigSQL, a novel task for disambiguating information-seeking requests for complex SQL generation towards data analysis agents. Additionally, we propose evaluating LLMs' ability to function as conversational agents by examining whether they can implicitly recognize and reason about ambiguity in conversation. ACT demonstrates substantial conversation modeling improvements over standard tuning approaches like supervised fine-tuning and DPO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available at pku-lm-resist-alignment.github.io.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen substantial growth, necessitating efficient model pruning techniques. Existing post-training pruning methods primarily measure weight importance in converged dense models, often overlooking changes in weight significance during the pruning process, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, facilitating global performance optimization. We are the first to employ the product of weights and gradients as a pruning metric in the context of LLM post-training pruning. This enables accurate identification of weight importance in massive models and significantly reduces computational complexity compared to methods using secondorder information. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber efficiently prunes models from LLaMA and OPT families (7B to 13B) on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-task dense scene understanding, which trains a model for multiple dense prediction tasks, has a wide range of application scenarios. Capturing long-range dependency and enhancing cross-task interactions are crucial to multi-task dense prediction. In this paper, we propose MTMamba++, a novel architecture for multi-task scene understanding featuring with a Mamba-based decoder. It contains two types of core blocks: self-task Mamba (STM) block and cross-task Mamba (CTM) block. STM handles long-range dependency by leveraging state-space models, while CTM explicitly models task interactions to facilitate information exchange across tasks. We design two types of CTM block, namely F-CTM and S-CTM, to enhance cross-task interaction from feature and semantic perspectives, respectively. Extensive experiments on NYUDv2, PASCAL-Context, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MTMamba++ over CNN-based, Transformer-based, and diffusion-based methods while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) often need to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain unfamiliar language skills or adapt to new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study that bridges the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicates the optimal experimental setup. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark but also in some specific domains including math, coding, and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on a real-life chat system which obtains satisfying performance.

Abstract: Second language (L2) learners can improve their pronunciation by imitating golden speech, especially when the speech that aligns with their respective speech characteristics. This study explores the hypothesis that learner-specific golden speech generated with zero-shot text-to-speech (ZS-TTS) techniques can be harnessed as an effective metric for measuring the pronunciation proficiency of L2 learners. Building on this exploration, the contributions of this study are at least two-fold: 1) design and development of a systematic framework for assessing the ability of a synthesis model to generate golden speech, and 2) in-depth investigations of the effectiveness of using golden speech in automatic pronunciation assessment (APA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on the L2-ARCTIC and Speechocean762 benchmark datasets suggest that our proposed modeling can yield significant performance improvements with respect to various assessment metrics in relation to some prior arts. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the role of golden speech in both ZS-TTS and APA, offering a promising regime for computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT).

Abstract: Current research efforts are focused on enhancing the thinking and reasoning capability of large language model (LLM) by prompting, data-driven emergence and inference-time computation. In this study, we consider stimulating language model's thinking and cognitive abilities from a modular perspective, which mimics the human brain architecture. We select a specific intermediate attention layer with newly implemented language heads. We conduct dual-layer fine-tuning by annotated (query, thought, answer) samples and show that the intermediate layer can also learn to decode fluent and reasonable language tokens. A two-pass inference mechanism is designed to generate thoughts then formal responses. The entire framework is called modularized thinking language model (MeTHanol) which can enhance LLM's cognitive behaviors as indicated by Theory of Mind (ToM) and Vignette-based experiments. Case studies also show that MeTHanol can plan and self-reflect and generate human-like thoughts and answers, even on unseen and open-domain tasks. MeTHanol can also adapt to a personalized prompt and behave as the specified character. Our study holds promise for significant cognitive gains from a modular perspective.

Abstract: An approach to improve network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We find pretrained models to be highly unclusterable and thus train models to be more modular using an ``enmeshment loss'' function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. Using automated interpretability measures, we show that our method finds clusters that learn different, disjoint, and smaller circuits for CIFAR-10 labels. Our approach provides a promising direction for making neural networks easier to interpret.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

<title>Overcoming Slow Decision Frequencies in Continuous Control: Model-Based Sequence Reinforcement Learning for Model-Free Control</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a "temporal recall" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Furthermore, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves comparable FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning.

Abstract: We show that existing evaluations for assessing the factuality of news from conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in high accuracies over time for LLM-based detectors-even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular false information from such sources can be easily identified due to its likely presence in pre-training/retrieval corpora or the emergence of salient, yet shallow, patterns in these datasets. Instead, we argue that a proper factuality evaluation dataset should test a model's ability to reason about current events by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive variants that challenge LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both evaluating and generating challenging news examples, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG-based evaluation helps discover more deceitful patterns.

<title>Beyond Right to be Forgotten: Managing Heterogeneity Side Effects Through Strategic Incentives</title>

Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) enables the removal of specific clients' data influence from trained models. However, in non-IID settings, removing clients creates critical side effects: remaining clients with similar data distributions suffer disproportionate performance degradation, while the global model's stability deteriorates. These vulnerable clients then have reduced incentives to stay in the federation, potentially triggering a cascade of withdrawals that further destabilize the system. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies how data heterogeneity impacts unlearning outcomes. Based on these insights, we model FU as a Stackelberg game where the server strategically offers payments to retain crucial clients based on their contribution to both unlearning effectiveness and system stability. Our rigorous equilibrium analysis reveals how data heterogeneity fundamentally shapes the trade-offs between system-wide objectives and client interests. Our approach improves global stability by up to 6.23\%, reduces worst-case client degradation by 10.05\%, and achieves up to 38.6\% runtime efficiency over complete retraining.

<title>Do Large Language Models Have an English Accent? Evaluating and Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs</title>

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to bridge the gap between source and target datasets using unlabeled test data, addressing domain shifts caused by corruptions like weather changes, noise, or sensor malfunctions in test time. Multi-Modal Continual Test-Time Adaptation (MM-CTTA), as an extension of standard TTA, further allows models to handle multi-modal inputs and adapt to continuously evolving target domains. However, MM-CTTA faces critical challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and reliability bias, which are rarely addressed effectively under multi-modal corruption scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Multi-modality Dynamic Analytic Adapter (MDAA), to tackle MM-CTTA tasks. MDAA introduces analytic learning,a closed-form training technique,through Analytic Classifiers (ACs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we design the Dynamic Late Fusion Mechanism (DLFM) to dynamically select and integrate reliable information from different modalities. Extensive experiments show that MDAA achieves state-of-the-art performance across the proposed tasks.

Abstract: The desires for better prediction accuracy and higher execution performance in neural networks never end. Neural architecture search (NAS) and tensor compilers are two popular techniques to optimize these two goals, but they are both limited to composing or optimizing existing manually designed operators rather than coming up with completely new designs. In this work, we explore the less studied direction of neural operator synthesis, which aims to automatically and efficiently discover novel neural operators with better accuracy and/or speed. We develop an end-to-end framework Syno, to realize practical neural operator synthesis. Syno makes use of a novel set of fine-grained primitives defined on tensor dimensions, which ensure various desired properties to ease model training, and also enable expression canonicalization techniques to avoid redundant candidates during search. Syno further adopts a novel guided synthesis flow to obtain valid operators matched with the specified input/output dimension sizes, and leverages efficient stochastic tree search algorithms to quickly explore the design space. We demonstrate that Syno discovers better operators with average speedups of $1.37\times$ to $2.06\times$ on various hardware and compiler choices, while keeping less than 1% accuracy loss even on NAS-optimized models.

<title>How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method</title>

Abstract: Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (gen-AI) is transforming industries, particularly in education and workforce training. This chapter introduces PRISM (Personalized, Rapid, and Immersive Skill Mastery), a scalable framework leveraging gen-AI and Digital Twins (DTs) to deliver adaptive, experiential learning. PRISM integrates sentiment analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to monitor learner comprehension and dynamically adjust content to meet course objectives. We further present the Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin for Education (MFDT-E) framework, aligning DT fidelity levels with Bloom's Taxonomy and the Kirkpatrick evaluation model to support undergraduate, master's, and doctoral training. Experimental validation shows that GPT-4 achieves 91 percent F1 in zero-shot sentiment analysis of teacher-student dialogues, while GPT-3.5 performs robustly in informal language contexts. Additionally, the system's effectiveness and scalability for immersive Industry 4.0 training are demonstrated through four VR modules: Home Scene, Factory Floor Tour, Capping Station DT, and PPE Inspection Training. These results highlight the potential of integrating generative AI with digital twins to enable personalized, efficient, and scalable education.

Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score.

Abstract: Background: Despite the current ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their reasoning behaviour. We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical imaging, addressing the chronic challenge of limited labeled data in healthcare settings. While SSL has shown impressive results, existing studies in the medical domain are often limited in scope, focusing on specific datasets or modalities, or evaluating only isolated aspects of model performance. This fragmented evaluation approach poses a significant challenge, as models deployed in critical medical settings must not only achieve high accuracy but also demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse datasets and varying conditions. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive evaluation of SSL methods within the medical domain, with a particular focus on robustness and generalizability. Using the MedMNIST dataset collection as a standardized benchmark, we evaluate 8 major SSL methods across 11 different medical datasets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of model performance in both in-domain scenarios and the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, while exploring the effect of various initialization strategies, model architectures, and multi-domain pre-training. We further assess the generalizability of SSL methods through cross-dataset evaluations and the in-domain performance with varying label proportions (1%, 10%, and 100%) to simulate real-world scenarios with limited supervision. We hope this comprehensive benchmark helps practitioners and researchers make more informed decisions when applying SSL methods to medical applications.

Abstract: Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Illegal souvenir collection strips an estimated five tonnes of seashells from Costa Rica's beaches each year. Yet, once these specimens are seized, their coastal origin -- Pacific or Caribbean -- cannot be verified easily due to the lack of information, preventing their return when confiscated by local authorities. To solve this issue, we introduce BackHome19K, the first large-scale image corpus (19{,}058 photographs, 516 species) annotated with coast-level labels, and propose a lightweight pipeline that infers provenance in real time on a mobile-grade CPU. A trained anomaly filter pre-screens uploads, increasing robustness to user-generated noise. On a held-out test set, the classifier attains 86.3\% balanced accuracy, while the filter rejects 93\% of 180 out-of-domain objects with zero false negatives. Deployed as a web application, the system has already processed 70{,}000 shells for wildlife officers in under three seconds per image, enabling confiscated specimens to be safely repatriated to their native ecosystems. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FIFCO/BackHome19K

Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Abstract: Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed. Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition has become an important research area, driven by the growing demand for human-computer interaction in fields such as sign language recognition, virtual and augmented reality, and robotics. Despite the rapid growth of the field, there are few surveys that comprehensively cover recent research developments, available solutions, and benchmark datasets. This survey addresses this gap by examining the latest advancements in hand gesture and 3D hand pose recognition from various types of camera input data including RGB images, depth images, and videos from monocular or multiview cameras, examining the differing methodological requirements of each approach. Furthermore, an overview of widely used datasets is provided, detailing their main characteristics and application domains. Finally, open challenges such as achieving robust recognition in real-world environments, handling occlusions, ensuring generalization across diverse users, and addressing computational efficiency for real-time applications are highlighted to guide future research directions. By synthesizing the objectives, methodologies, and applications of recent studies, this survey offers valuable insights into current trends, challenges, and opportunities for future research in human hand gesture recognition.

<title>Can Large Language Models Be Trusted as Evolutionary Optimizers for Network-Structured Combinatorial Problems?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interest in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as primary optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary optimizer (EVO) and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-based operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLMs outputs. Moreover, we explore a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based EVO. Our findings present perspectives on integrating LLMs into evolutionary computation and discuss paths that may support scalable and context-aware optimization in networked systems.

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Imputation (MTSI) is crucial for many applications, such as healthcare monitoring and traffic management, where incomplete data can compromise decision-making. Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.

<title>LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.03387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We challenge the prevailing assumption that complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) necessitates massive training data. We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.

<title>Ask and Remember: A Questions-Only Replay Strategy for Continual Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning in Visual Question Answering (VQACL) requires models to acquire new visual-linguistic skills (plasticity) while preserving previously learned knowledge (stability). The inherent multimodality of VQACL exacerbates this challenge, as models must balance stability across visual and textual domains while adapting to novel objects and reasoning tasks. Existing methods, primarily designed for unimodal settings, often fall short in addressing this dual requirement. In this work, we present QUestion-only replay with Attention Distillation (QUAD), a novel approach for VQACL that leverages only past task questions for regularization. By eliminating the need to store visual data, QUAD not only reduces memory overhead, but also alleviates privacy concerns. Our method introduces a Question-only Replay mechanism that selectively reuses prior task questions to counteract overfitting to the answer space of the current task, addressing the problem out of answer set. Complementing this, we propose Attention Consistency Distillation to enforce both intra-modal and inter-modal attention consistency across tasks, preserving essential visual-linguistic associations. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and NExT-QA demonstrate that QUAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust performance in continual VQA.

Abstract: Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS) is a widely used outlier or anomaly detection method known for its computational efficiency and simplicity. However, its assumption of feature independence limits its ability to detect anomalies in datasets where interactions between features are critical. In this paper, we propose the Extended Histogram-Based Outlier Score (EHBOS), which enhances HBOS by incorporating two-dimensional histograms to capture dependencies between feature pairs. This extension allows EHBOS to identify contextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect. We evaluate EHBOS on 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse anomaly detection scenarios. EHBOS outperforms HBOS on several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical in defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC. These results highlight that EHBOS can be a valuable extension to HBOS, with the ability to model complex feature dependencies. EHBOS offers a powerful new tool for anomaly detection, particularly in datasets where contextual or relational anomalies play a significant role.

Abstract: As AI systems integrate into critical infrastructure, security gaps in AI compliance frameworks demand urgent attention. This paper audits and quantifies security risks in three major AI governance standards: NIST AI RMF 1.0, UK's AI and Data Protection Risk Toolkit, and the EU's ALTAI. Using a novel risk assessment methodology, we develop four key metrics: Risk Severity Index (RSI), Attack Potential Index (AVPI), Compliance-Security Gap Percentage (CSGP), and Root Cause Vulnerability Score (RCVS). Our analysis identifies 136 concerns across the frameworks, exposing significant gaps. NIST fails to address 69.23 percent of identified risks, ALTAI has the highest attack vector vulnerability (AVPI = 0.51) and the ICO Toolkit has the largest compliance-security gap, with 80.00 percent of high-risk concerns remaining unresolved. Root cause analysis highlights under-defined processes (ALTAI RCVS = 033) and weak implementation guidance (NIST and ICO RCVS = 0.25) as critical weaknesses. These findings emphasize the need for stronger, enforceable security controls in AI compliance. We offer targeted recommendations to enhance security posture and bridge the gap between compliance and real-world AI risks.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

<title>Fast or Better? Balancing Accuracy and Cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Flexible User Control</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to mitigate large language model (LLM) hallucinations by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks often apply retrieval indiscriminately,leading to inefficiencies-over-retrieving when unnecessary or failing to retrieve iteratively when required for complex reasoning. Recent adaptive retrieval strategies, though adaptively navigates these retrieval strategies, predict only based on query complexity and lacks user-driven flexibility, making them infeasible for diverse user application needs. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-controllable RAG framework that enables dynamic adjustment of the accuracy-cost trade-off. Our approach leverages two classifiers: one trained to prioritize accuracy and another to prioritize retrieval efficiency. Via an interpretable control parameter $\alpha$, users can seamlessly navigate between minimal-cost retrieval and high-accuracy retrieval based on their specific requirements. We empirically demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy, retrieval cost, and user controllability, making it a practical and adaptable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Assessing whether AI-generated images are substantially similar to source works is a crucial step in resolving copyright disputes. In this paper, we propose CopyJudge, a novel automated infringement identification framework that leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) to simulate practical court processes for determining substantial similarity between copyrighted images and those generated by text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we employ an abstraction-filtration-comparison test framework based on the multi-LVLM debate to assess the likelihood of infringement and provide detailed judgment rationales. Based on these judgments, we further introduce a general LVLM-based mitigation strategy that automatically optimizes infringing prompts by avoiding sensitive expressions while preserving the non-infringing content. Furthermore, assuming the input noise is controllable, our approach can be enhanced by iteratively exploring non-infringing noise vectors within the diffusion latent space, even without modifying the original prompts. Experimental results show that our automated identification method achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance, while offering superior generalization and interpretability across various forms of infringement, and that our mitigation method more effectively mitigates memorization and IP infringement with a high degree of alignment to the original non-infringing expressions.

<title>Protecting Users From Themselves: Safeguarding Contextual Privacy in Interactions with Conversational Agents</title>

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks associated with them. The moment users share information with these agents-such as large language models (LLMs)-their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLM-based Conversational Agents (LCAs). It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LCAs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally deployable framework that operates between users and LCAs, identifying and reformulating out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals. Notably, about 76% of participants in our human evaluation preferred the reformulated prompts over the original ones, validating the usability and effectiveness of contextual privacy in our proposed framework. We opensource the code at https://github.com/IBM/contextual-privacy-LLM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated vast capabilities on generative tasks in recent years, yet they struggle with guaranteeing the factual correctness of the generated content. This makes these models unreliable in realistic situations where factually accurate responses are expected. In this paper, we propose FactReasoner, a new factuality assessor that relies on probabilistic reasoning to assess the factuality of a long-form generated response. Specifically, FactReasoner decomposes the response into atomic units, retrieves relevant contexts for them from an external knowledge source, and constructs a joint probability distribution over the atoms and contexts using probabilistic encodings of the logical relationships (entailment, contradiction) between the textual utterances corresponding to the atoms and contexts. FactReasoner then computes the posterior probability of whether atomic units in the response are supported by the retrieved contexts. Our experiments on labeled and unlabeled benchmark datasets demonstrate clearly that FactReasoner improves considerably over state-of-the-art prompt-based approaches in terms of both factual precision and recall.

Abstract: Open-world continual learning (OWCL) adapts to sequential tasks with open samples, learning knowledge incrementally while preventing forgetting. However, existing OWCL still requires a large amount of labeled data for training, which is often impractical in real-world applications. Given that new categories/entities typically come with limited annotations and are in small quantities, a more realistic situation is OWCL with scarce labeled data, i.e., few-shot training samples. Hence, this paper investigates the problem of open-world few-shot continual learning (OFCL), challenging in (i) learning unbounded tasks without forgetting previous knowledge and avoiding overfitting, (ii) constructing compact decision boundaries for open detection with limited labeled data, and (iii) transferring knowledge about knowns and unknowns and even update the unknowns to knowns once the labels of open samples are learned. In response, we propose a novel OFCL framework that integrates three key components: (1) an instance-wise token augmentation (ITA) that represents and enriches sample representations with additional knowledge, (2) a margin-based open boundary (MOB) that supports open detection with new tasks emerge over time, and (3) an adaptive knowledge space (AKS) that endows unknowns with knowledge for the updating from unknowns to knowns. Finally, extensive experiments show that the proposed OFCL framework outperforms all baselines remarkably with practical importance and reproducibility. The source code is released at https://github.com/liyj1201/OFCL.

Abstract: Many studies combine text and audio to capture multi-modal information but they overlook the model's generalization ability on new datasets. Introducing new datasets may affect the feature space of the original dataset, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, large model parameters can significantly impact training performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel task called Text-Audio Incremental Learning (TAIL) task for text-audio retrieval, and propose a new method, PTAT, Prompt Tuning for Audio-Text incremental learning. This method utilizes prompt tuning to optimize the model parameters while incorporating an audio-text similarity and feature distillation module to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We benchmark our method and previous incremental learning methods on AudioCaps, Clotho, BBC Sound Effects and Audioset datasets, and our method outperforms previous methods significantly, particularly demonstrating stronger resistance to forgetting on older datasets. Compared to the full-parameters Finetune (Sequential) method, our model only requires 2.42\% of its parameters, achieving 4.46\% higher performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled the creation of deceptively real images, posing significant security risks when misused. In this study, we empirically show that different timesteps of DDIM inversion reveal varying subtle distinctions between synthetic and real images that are extractable for detection, in the forms of such as Fourier power spectrum high-frequency discrepancies and inter-pixel variance distributions. Based on these observations, we propose a novel synthetic image detection method that directly utilizes features of intermediately noised images by training an ensemble on multiple noised timesteps, circumventing conventional reconstruction-based strategies. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce a metric-grounded explanation generation and refinement module to identify and explain AI-generated flaws. Additionally, we construct the GenHard and GenExplain benchmarks to provide detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and challenging samples respectively, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Shadowlized/ESIDE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in open-ended dialogue, yet their inability to retain and retrieve relevant information from long-term interactions limits their effectiveness in applications requiring sustained personalization. External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.

Abstract: In filmmaking, directors typically allow actors to perform freely based on the script before providing specific guidance on how to present key actions. AI-generated content faces similar requirements, where users not only need automatic generation of lip synchronization and basic gestures from audio input but also desire semantically accurate and expressive body movement that can be ``directly guided'' through text descriptions. Therefore, we present VersaAnimator, a versatile framework that synthesizes expressive talking human videos from arbitrary portrait images. Specifically, we design a motion generator that produces basic rhythmic movements from audio input and supports text-prompt control for specific actions. The generated whole-body 3D motion tokens can animate portraits of various scales, producing talking heads, half-body gestures and even leg movements for whole-body images. Besides, we introduce a multi-modal controlled video diffusion that generates photorealistic videos, where speech signals govern lip synchronization, facial expressions, and head motions while body movements are guided by the 2D poses. Furthermore, we introduce a token2pose translator to smoothly map 3D motion tokens to 2D pose sequences. This design mitigates the stiffness resulting from direct 3D to 2D conversion and enhances the details of the generated body movements. Extensive experiments shows that VersaAnimator synthesizes lip-synced and identity-preserving videos while generating expressive and semantically meaningful whole-body motions.

<title>Representing 3D Shapes With 64 Latent Vectors for 3D Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Constructing a compressed latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE) is the key for efficient 3D diffusion models. This paper introduces COD-VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation. The code is available at https://github.com/join16/COD-VAE.

Abstract: Pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of out of hospital cardiac arrest that requires fast diagnosis. While computed tomography pulmonary angiography is the standard diagnostic tool, it is not always accessible. Electrocardiography is an essential tool for diagnosing mul- tiple cardiac anomalies, as it is affordable, fast and available in many settings. However, the availability of public ECG datasets, specially for PE, is limited and, in practice, these datasets tend to be small, making it essential to optimize learning strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of multiple neural networks in order to assess the impact of various approaches. Moreover, we check whether these practices enhance model generalization when transfer learning is used to translate infor- mation learned in larger ECG datasets, such as PTB-XL, CPSC18 and MedalCare-XL, to a smaller, more challenging dataset for PE. By lever- aging transfer learning, we analyze the extent to which we can improve learning efficiency and predictive performance on limited data.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research faces a gap between analyzing simple circuits in toy tasks and discovering features in large models. To bridge this gap, we propose text-to-SQL generation as an ideal task to study, as it combines the formal structure of toy tasks with real-world complexity. We introduce TinySQL, a synthetic dataset, progressing from basic to advanced SQL operations, and train models ranging from 33M to 1B parameters to establish a comprehensive testbed for interpretability. We apply multiple complementary interpretability techniques, including Edge Attribution Patching and Sparse Autoencoders, to identify minimal circuits and components supporting SQL generation. We compare circuits for different SQL subskills, evaluating their minimality, reliability, and identifiability. Finally, we conduct a layerwise logit lens analysis to reveal how models compose SQL queries across layers: from intent recognition to schema resolution to structured generation. Our work provides a robust framework for probing and comparing interpretability methods in a structured, progressively complex setting.

Abstract: Performing robotic grasping from a cluttered bin based on human instructions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the nuances of free-form language and the spatial relationships between objects. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics. Our project page are publicly available at https://quanhaol.github.io/magicmotion-site.

Abstract: The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates zero-shot synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Notably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.

Abstract: As humans learn new skills and apply their existing knowledge while maintaining previously learned information, "continual learning" in machine learning aims to incorporate new data while retaining and utilizing past knowledge. However, existing machine learning methods often does not mimic human learning where tasks are intermixed due to individual preferences and environmental conditions. Humans typically switch between tasks instead of completely mastering one task before proceeding to the next. To explore how human-like task switching can enhance learning efficiency, we propose a multi task learning architecture that alternates tasks based on task-agnostic measures such as "learning progress" and "neural computational energy expenditure". To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we run several systematic experiments by using a set of effect-prediction tasks executed by a simulated manipulator robot. The experiments show that our approach surpasses random interleaved and sequential task learning in terms of average learning accuracy. Moreover, by including energy expenditure in the task switching logic, our approach can still perform favorably while reducing neural energy expenditure.

arXiv:2504.01301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Bi-LAT, a novel imitation learning framework that unifies bilateral control with natural language processing to achieve precise force modulation in robotic manipulation. Bi-LAT leverages joint position, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower teleoperation while also integrating visual and linguistic cues to dynamically adjust applied force. By encoding human instructions such as "softly grasp the cup" or "strongly twist the sponge" through a multimodal Transformer-based model, Bi-LAT learns to distinguish nuanced force requirements in real-world tasks. We demonstrate Bi-LAT's performance in (1) unimanual cup-stacking scenario where the robot accurately modulates grasp force based on language commands, and (2) bimanual sponge-twisting task that requires coordinated force control. Experimental results show that Bi-LAT effectively reproduces the instructed force levels, particularly when incorporating SigLIP among tested language encoders. Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating natural language cues into imitation learning, paving the way for more intuitive and adaptive human-robot interaction.

Abstract: The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full-horizon paths. However, planning full-horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real-world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is Real-Time LaCAM, the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full-horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language-based communication with AI-powered chatbots. These models are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to articulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility, studies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in inefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations of LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties users face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI interactions through an educational experiment in which participants receive structured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three types of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a structured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and prompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users. Using Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction analysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring behavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by examining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the overall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured prompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication. By comparing different instructional frameworks, we offer insights into more effective approaches for improving user competency in AI interactions, with implications for AI literacy, chatbot usability, and the design of more responsive AI systems.

Abstract: Modern enterprise computing systems integrate numerous subsystems to resolve a common task by yielding emergent behavior. A widespread approach is using services implemented with Web technologies like REST or OpenAPI, which offer an interaction mechanism and service documentation standard, respectively. Each service represents a specific business functionality, allowing encapsulation and easier maintenance. Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual service level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated service composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice due to their reliance on complex formal modeling. Within this Ph.D. thesis, we analyze the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically integrate the services based on a natural language input. The result is a reusable service composition, e.g., as program code. While not always generating entirely correct results, the result can still be helpful by providing integration engineers with a close approximation of a suitable solution, which requires little effort to become operational. Our research involves (i) introducing a software architecture for automated service composition using LLMs, (ii) analyzing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for service discovery, (iii) proposing a novel natural language query-based benchmark for service discovery, and (iv) extending the benchmark to complete service composition scenarios. We have presented our software architecture as Compositio Prompto, the analysis of RAG for service discovery, and submitted a proposal for the service discovery benchmark. Open topics are primarily the extension of the service discovery benchmark to service composition scenarios and the improvements of the service composition generation, e.g., using fine-tuning or LLM agents.

Abstract: Radar-based HAR has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional monitoring approaches, such as wearable devices and camera-based systems, due to its unique privacy preservation and robustness advantages. However, existing solutions based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, although effective, are computationally demanding during deployment. This limits their applicability in scenarios with constrained resources or those requiring multiple sensors. Advanced architectures, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and State-Space Model (SSM) architectures, offer improved modeling capabilities and have made efforts toward lightweight designs. However, their computational complexity remains relatively high. To leverage the strengths of transformer architectures while simultaneously enhancing accuracy and reducing computational complexity, this paper introduces RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, radar micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM specifically tailored for radar-based HAR. Across three diverse datasets, RadMamba matches the top-performing previous model's 99.8% classification accuracy on Dataset DIAT with only 1/400 of its parameters and equals the leading models' 92.0% accuracy on Dataset CI4R with merely 1/10 of their parameters. In scenarios with continuous sequences of actions evaluated on Dataset UoG2020, RadMamba surpasses other models with significantly higher parameter counts by at least 3%, achieving this with only 6.7k parameters.

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens. We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books, piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus, likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama 3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Lifelong Person Re-identification (LReID) suffers from a key challenge in preserving old knowledge while adapting to new information. The existing solutions include rehearsal-based and rehearsal-free methods to address this challenge. Rehearsal-based approaches rely on knowledge distillation, continuously accumulating forgetting during the distillation process. Rehearsal-free methods insufficiently learn the distribution of each domain, leading to forgetfulness over time. To solve these issues, we propose a novel Distribution-aware Forgetting Compensation (DAFC) model that explores cross-domain shared representation learning and domain-specific distribution integration without using old exemplars or knowledge distillation. We propose a Text-driven Prompt Aggregation (TPA) that utilizes text features to enrich prompt elements and guide the prompt model to learn fine-grained representations for each instance. This can enhance the differentiation of identity information and establish the foundation for domain distribution awareness. Then, Distribution-based Awareness and Integration (DAI) is designed to capture each domain-specific distribution by a dedicated expert network and adaptively consolidate them into a shared region in high-dimensional space. In this manner, DAI can consolidate and enhance cross-domain shared representation learning while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we develop a Knowledge Consolidation Mechanism (KCM) that comprises instance-level discrimination and cross-domain consistency alignment strategies to facilitate model adaptive learning of new knowledge from the current domain and promote knowledge consolidation learning between acquired domain-specific distributions, respectively. Experimental results show that our DAFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/LiuShiBen/DAFC.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generative models have rapidly advanced and found widespread applications across fields like entertainment, education, and marketing. However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse. Our project page is at https://wrt2000.github.io/BadVideo2025/.

Abstract: Memes often merge visuals with brief text to share humor or opinions, yet some memes contain harmful messages such as hate speech. In this paper, we introduces MemeBLIP2, a light weight multimodal system that detects harmful memes by combining image and text features effectively. We build on previous studies by adding modules that align image and text representations into a shared space and fuse them for better classification. Using BLIP-2 as the core vision-language model, our system is evaluated on the PrideMM datasets. The results show that MemeBLIP2 can capture subtle cues in both modalities, even in cases with ironic or culturally specific content, thereby improving the detection of harmful material.

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision introduces challenges for robotic task definition such as ambiguity and verbosity. Moreover, in some public settings where quiet is required, such as libraries or hospitals, verbal communication with robots is inappropriate. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

Abstract: The widespread availability of video recording through smartphones and digital devices has made video-based evidence more accessible than ever. Surveillance footage plays a crucial role in security, law enforcement, and judicial processes. However, with the rise of advanced video editing tools, tampering with digital recordings has become increasingly easy, raising concerns about their authenticity. Ensuring the integrity of surveillance videos is essential, as manipulated footage can lead to misinformation and undermine judicial decisions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing forensic techniques used to detect video forgery, focusing on their effectiveness in verifying the authenticity of surveillance recordings. Various methods, including compression-based analysis, frame duplication detection, and machine learning-based approaches, are explored. The findings highlight the growing necessity for more robust forensic techniques to counteract evolving forgery methods.

<title>TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility</title>

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a key task in industrial settings, where minimizing operational costs is essential. Deploying deep learning models within Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduces specific challenges due to limited computational power and bandwidth of edge devices. This study investigates how to perform VAD effectively under such constraints by leveraging compact, efficient processing strategies. We evaluate several data compression techniques, examining the tradeoff between system latency and detection accuracy. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate that significant compression can be achieved with minimal loss in anomaly detection performance compared to uncompressed data. Current results show up to 80% reduction in end-to-end inference time, including edge processing, transmission, and server computation.

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge). Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary, based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental scenarios.

Abstract: A two stage novel generation framework (outline -> section outline -> manuscript) is widely used in long novel generation,(e.g., \textsc{DOME}, \textsc{Plan\&amp;Write}, \textsc{Long Writer}), but study of such framework in ultra long novel(>1M words) reconstruction is little. Building on recent text compression methods (\textsc{LLMZip}, \textsc{LLM2Vec}), we conduct an information-theoretic analysis to quantify semantic distortion under different compression-expansion ratios. We examine how outline length affects information preservation. Experiments on ultra-long novels show that the optimal compression-expansion ratio significantly reduces semantic distortion compared to other non-optimal compression-expansion ratio.

Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks emerges as a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Vulnerability, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity across multiple experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial robustness of these fine-tuned models, analyzing persona shifts and interpretability traits to understand how dataset factors contribute to attack success rates. Lastly, we explore causal relationships that offer new insights into adversarial defense strategies, highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/accidental_vulnerability.

<title>Unveil Multi-Picture Descriptions for Multilingual Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection via Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

<title>Token Reduction Should Go Beyond Efficiency in Generative Models -- From Vision, Language to Multimodality</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18227</link>

arXiv:2505.18227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks. Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.

<title>An AI Capability Threshold for Rent-Funded Universal Basic Income in an AI-Automated Economy</title>

Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate $s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma < 1$, we analyze how the AI capability threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times existing automation productivity to finance an 11%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst case situation where *no* new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15% to about 33% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological progress scenarios.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer, and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency than RTX 3090 GPU.

Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) involves complex interdependencies among processes, materials, feedstock, and post-processing steps. However, the underlying relationships and domain knowledge remain fragmented across literature and static databases that often require expert-level queries, limiting their applicability in design and planning. To address these limitations, we develop a novel and structured knowledge graph (KG), representing 53 distinct metals and alloys across seven material categories, nine AM processes, four feedstock types, and corresponding post-processing requirements. A large language model (LLM) interface, guided by a few-shot prompting strategy, enables natural language querying without the need for formal query syntax. The system supports a range of tasks, including compatibility evaluation, constraint-based filtering, and design for AM (DfAM) guidance. User queries in natural language are normalized, translated into Cypher, and executed on the KG, with results returned in a structured format. This work introduces the first interactive system that connects a domain-specific metal AM KG with an LLM interface, delivering accessible and explainable decision support for engineers and promoting human-centered tools in manufacturing knowledge systems.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Local and Global Area Transcription (Grid-LoGAT) system for Video Question Answering (VideoQA). The system operates in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based questions we created using NExT-QA. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.)

Abstract: Existing threat modeling frameworks related to transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often narrow in scope, labor-intensive, and require substantial cybersecurity expertise. To this end, we introduce the Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling Framework (TraCR-TMF), a large language model (LLM)-based threat modeling framework for transportation CPS that requires limited cybersecurity expert intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and relevant countermeasures for transportation CPS. Three LLM-based approaches support these identifications: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation approach requiring no cybersecurity expert intervention, (ii) an in-context learning approach with low expert intervention, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning approach with moderate expert intervention. TraCR-TMF offers LLM-based attack path identification for critical assets based on vulnerabilities across transportation CPS entities. Additionally, it incorporates the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of known exploited vulnerabilities to prioritize threat mitigations. The framework was evaluated through two cases. First, the framework identified relevant attack techniques for various transportation CPS applications, 73% of which were validated by cybersecurity experts as correct. Second, the framework was used to identify attack paths for a target asset in a real-world cyberattack incident. TraCR-TMF successfully predicted exploitations, like lateral movement of adversaries, data exfiltration, and data encryption for ransomware, as reported in the incident. These findings show the efficacy of TraCR-TMF in transportation CPS threat modeling, while reducing the need for extensive involvement of cybersecurity experts. To facilitate real-world adoptions, all our codes are shared via an open-source repository.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research that aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should be integrated during training to reduce the sim-to-real gap. While there are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning, analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior performance from fewer environment interactions. However, there is no safeguarding approach for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning. We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. Using numerical experiments on three control tasks, we evaluate how different safeguards affect learning. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without compromising performance.

Abstract: Spectral band replication (SBR) enables bit-efficient coding by generating high-frequency bands from the low-frequency ones. However, it only utilizes coarse spectral features upon a subband-wise signal replication, limiting adaptability to diverse acoustic signals. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of a deep neural network (DNN)-based generative approach for coding the high-frequency bands, which we call neural spectral band generation (n-SBG). Specifically, we propose a DNN-based encoder-decoder structure to extract and quantize the side information related to the high-frequency components and generate the components given both the side information and the decoded core-band signals. The whole coding pipeline is optimized with generative adversarial criteria to enable the generation of perceptually plausible sound. From experiments using AAC as the core codec, we show that the proposed method achieves a better perceptual quality than HE-AAC-v1 with much less side information.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy.

<title>LaMAGIC2: Advanced Circuit Formulations for Language Model-Based Analog Topology Generation</title>

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts. The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2) token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation. SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |), and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

<title>Intersectional Bias in Japanese Large Language Models from a Contextualized Perspective</title>

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow, we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal combination of social attributes.

Abstract: Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy, characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent: operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level, we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and useful AI agents in the real world.

<title>Conformal Safety Shielding for Imperfect-Perception Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in local safety. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

Abstract: Lidar SLAM plays a significant role in mobile robot navigation and high-definition map construction. However, existing methods often face a trade-off between localization accuracy and system robustness in scenarios with a high proportion of dynamic objects, point cloud distortion, and unstructured environments. To address this issue, we propose a neural descriptors-based adaptive noise filtering strategy for SLAM, named ADA-DPM, which improves the performance of localization and mapping tasks through three key technical innovations. Firstly, to tackle dynamic object interference, we design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict and filter out dynamic feature points, eliminating the ego-motion interference caused by dynamic objects. Secondly, to mitigate the impact of noise and unstructured feature points, we propose the Global Importance Scoring Head that adaptively selects high-contribution feature points while suppressing the influence of noise and unstructured feature points. Moreover, we introduce the Cross-Layer Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to construct multi-scale neighborhood graphs, fusing local structural information across different scales and improving the discriminative power of overlapping features. Finally, experimental validations on multiple public datasets confirm the effectiveness of ADA-DPM.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models. Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale language models.

Abstract: Insect pests continue to bring a serious threat to crop yields around the world, and traditional methods for monitoring them are often slow, manual, and difficult to scale. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized AI, yet they struggle with zero-shot deployment in real-world industrial settings due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. To bridge this gap, Superb AI introduces ZERO, an industry-ready vision foundation model that leverages multi-modal prompting (textual and visual) for generalization without retraining. Trained on a compact yet representative 0.9 million annotated samples from a proprietary billion-scale industrial dataset, ZERO demonstrates competitive performance on academic benchmarks like LVIS-Val and significantly outperforms existing models across 37 diverse industrial datasets. Furthermore, ZERO achieved 2nd place in the CVPR 2025 Object Instance Detection Challenge and 4th place in the Foundational Few-shot Object Detection Challenge, highlighting its practical deployability and generalizability with minimal adaptation and limited data. To the best of our knowledge, ZERO is the first vision foundation model explicitly built for domain-specific, zero-shot industrial applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks, representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders. These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and knowledge distillation.

<title>Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen Visual Unicode Representations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend. However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally, the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual settings. In this paper, we introduce Video Diffusion for Action Reasoning (Vidar), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), Vidar generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.

Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks.

Summary: 
Service composition in software systems is a challenge often limited by reasoning capabilities and execution mechanisms. This paper proposes integrating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs, enabled by large language models, to address these challenges. LRMs handle semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity, while LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and interoperability. By combining these paradigms into an integrated LRM-LAM framework, automated service composition can bridge the gap between intention and execution. This approach allows systems to reason about service requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows. Ultimately, this integration aims to transform service composition into a fully automated, user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However, each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the potential to transform service composition into a fully automated, user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods, which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework, enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

<div> generalization, AI systems, compositional tasks, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex

Summary:
The article introduces MIRAGE, a framework inspired by how the human brain achieves systematic compositional generalization through the interplay of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. MIRAGE consists of two modules: a Neural Decomposer and a Schema Engine, mimicking the brain's deliberative and intuitive processes. The Neural Decomposer, akin to neocortical computation, iteratively refines sequence representations using decompositions. The Schema Engine emulates the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex loop by extracting and applying reusable schemas from episodic memory. By incorporating schematic structures into the Transformer component, MIRAGE demonstrates systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark with high accuracy. Ablation studies emphasize the importance of extracted schemas and iterative refinement in achieving systematicity. MIRAGE's success lies in its ability to apply and transform explicit schemas to solve entirely novel tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in systematic generalization tasks with minimal parameters. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC "System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas, storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99% accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement process.

Summary:
This research introduces a novel history encoder that enables stable training of humanoid policies in the Gymnasium Humanoid-v4 environment with incomplete state information. The environment objective is to walk forward without falling, and the learned policy achieves comparable performance to full state access methods despite utilizing only a subset of the original states. The policy demonstrates adaptability to variations in robot properties, such as body part masses. The key to success lies in the history encoder, which processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated into a model-free algorithm, the encoder ensures robust decision-making by reconstructing essential contextual information from recent observations. This breakthrough shows promise for effective policy learning in high-dimensional tasks like robotic control under partial observability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4 environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access, despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover, the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust decision-making.

<div> incremental training, Temporal Knowledge Graph, entity similarity, weighted sampling, link prediction <br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces an incremental training framework for Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to address challenges posed by evolving TKGs. The framework enhances existing TKG completion models by incorporating an enhancement layer and a weighted sampling strategy. The enhancement layer defines entity similarity on a global scale, going beyond local neighborhood proximity used by traditional methods. The weighted sampling strategy focuses on edges related to infrequently occurring entities during training. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link prediction, and handling long-tail entities. The method achieves a significant improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) on these datasets, indicating its potential in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving the robustness of TKG completion models, especially in scenarios where new entities or sparse connections are involved. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an incremental training context

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

Summary: 
The article introduces Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. It extends the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm to handle multi-objective optimization by using a set of policies to explore different regions of the solution space. The algorithm maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search and adapts policies based on the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. Pareto-NRPA is benchmarked on a bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and a neural architecture search task, demonstrating competitive performance in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces.

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15 applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code, environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Map.

arXiv:2507.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here, we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers, including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data, accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR, and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions, including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit systems.

Summary:
This paper discusses lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor relations, focusing on total (cyclic) orders where each element has a distinct predecessor. Previous approaches using weighted first-order model counting struggled with practical applications due to encoding linear order predicates. This work introduces an algorithm that natively supports predecessor relations, providing exponential speedups for immediate and second predecessors and handling general k-th predecessor relations efficiently. Experimental results showed significant speed improvements, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in various inference tasks and combinatorial math problems. <div>
arXiv:2507.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC), which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate. Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations, which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm, achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces knowledge grafting as a mechanism to optimize AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring selected features from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model. This approach results in an 88.54% reduction in model size while improving generalization capability. The new rootstock model achieves a validation accuracy of 89.97%, maintaining lower validation loss compared to the donor model. It also performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. This method addresses the size vs. performance trade-off, enabling AI frameworks to be deployed on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. The approach was tested in an agricultural weed detection scenario and can be extended to various edge computing scenarios, potentially accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support, similar to how horticultural grafting enables cultivation in challenging agri-based environments. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger, more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios. Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs. donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however, it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

Summary: In imperfect-information games, where agents must make decisions based on partial knowledge, the Belief Stochastic Game model allows state estimation within the game model itself. Two approaches were explored to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension using Belief Propagation. Evaluation across two games showed that constraint-based beliefs can yield results similar to probabilistic inference, with minimal impact on agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief states alone may be sufficient for effective decision-making in various settings. <div>

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition, including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations. Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity, calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA, Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of classical rule-based systems.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself. We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router, a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

Abstract: Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores, while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning interventions.

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images. Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately 287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content, particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from AI-generated content

The second model, incorporating a pre-trained CLIP model for alignment, showed improvement in perceptual similarity. The third model, which fine-tuned the CLIP model's self- and cross-attention layers, enhanced text-image alignment but still lagged behind the first model in performance. Qualitatively, the sketches generated by the baseline Stable Diffusion model displayed clear facial features, demonstrating its robustness despite its simplicity. Iterative refinement further improved perceptual similarity in the models. The study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and cross-attention layers resulted in the best alignment between text descriptions and sketches. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3) novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2 but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1 demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a baseline despite its simplicity.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Summary:
Innovator introduces a novel approach to addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting in large language models (LLMs) when continued pretraining with scientific data. By transforming a pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model, Innovator separates general and scientific knowledge into specialized experts. Through a four-stage upcycle training paradigm, Innovator achieves significant improvements in scientific tasks while maintaining high performance in general tasks. With 64 specialized scientific experts and a shared general expert, Innovator extends the capabilities of LLMs like Qwen2.5-7B. Innovator-Reason, post-trained for reasoning enhancement, demonstrates excellent performance in solving complex scientific problems. Overall, Innovator's approach allows for effective integration of scientific and general knowledge in LLMs without compromising performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1) Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets. Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64 specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99% performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements over 30%.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk, competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS, a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies, enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic trading in complex financial systems.

The paper discusses the concept of concept probing in neural networks, where additional classifiers are trained to map internal representations to human-defined concepts. The performance of these probes depends on the layer being probed, necessitating the identification of the appropriate layer for a given concept. The authors propose a method to automatically determine which layer's representations should be probed based on their informativeness and regularity with respect to the concept. Through an extensive empirical analysis on various neural network models and datasets, the effectiveness of this approach is validated.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing, additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models and datasets.

<div> Keywords: machine unlearning, sparse models, un-pruning, retention of data, model pruning

Summary: 
Machine unlearning is crucial for addressing the right to be forgotten, but sparse models present challenges not well studied. Deleted data impacts pruned topology in sparse models, leading to the introduction of the concept of un-pruning to address this issue. An un-pruning algorithm is proposed to approximate pruned topology based on retained data, integrating seamlessly with existing unlearning algorithms and having an upper-bound error in theory. The algorithm is applicable to both structured and unstructured sparse models. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is found unreliable for assessing forgotten data, prompting the development of new metrics for sparse models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms, highlighting the importance of considering retained data in the unlearning process. <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology ``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

Abstract: Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks. Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.

<div> Keywords: single-pixel imaging, fluorescence microscopy, autoencoder, reconstruction, multispectral imaging

Summary:
Single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy requires fast acquisition and reconstruction. Traditional methods use total variation minimization, but a new approach involves training an autoencoder through self-supervision. This autoencoder learns an encoder (measurement matrix) and a decoder, which can enhance compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. The learned encoder is integrated into the physical device for multispectral and intensity data acquisition. This approach significantly reduces reconstruction time, improves image quality, and enables multispectral reconstructions. By leveraging data to learn measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, single-pixel fluorescence microscopy can advance diagnosis and biological research. Notably, this technique provides cost-effective multispectral imaging, benefiting the field at a fraction of the expense.

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

<div> Keywords: Language models, Specification Self-Correction, in-context reward hacking, flawed specifications, multi-step inference process

Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses the susceptibility of language models (LMs) to in-context reward hacking due to flawed specifications. To address this issue, the authors propose Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a test-time framework that enables LMs to identify and correct flaws in their guiding specifications. The SSC process involves a multi-step inference process where the model generates a response, critiques it, and then revises the specification to remove loopholes. Experimental results across creative writing and coding tasks show that LMs initially exploit tainted specifications in 50-70% of cases, but the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90%. Importantly, this dynamic repair occurs at inference time without weight modifications, leading to more aligned model behavior. The code for SSC implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at https://github.com/vicgalle/specification-self-correction .

<div> Keywords: LLMs, agentic program repair, Engineering Agent, test failures, patch generation

Summary: 
With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), agentic program repair has become possible on a large scale within organizations. The Engineering Agent developed in this work utilizes Llama as a base and the ReAct harness to fix source code based on test failures. The agent reasons through a set of actions, receives feedback through static analysis and test failures, and ensures patch conformity with LLM-as-a-Judge. Offline evaluations showed the specialized 70B model's competitiveness and the benefits of symbolic information in the ReAct harness. In production, 80% of generated fixes were reviewed, with 31.5% successfully implemented. Feedback from engineers highlighted quick approvals, gratitude, and surprise for the Engineering Agent's solutions. Mixed feedback was received when fixes were partially correct, serving as a good starting point for further refinement. <div>

Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator, the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness (neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of 42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good starting point.

<div> Keywords: Image captioning, Transformer architectures, attention mechanism, CNN-LSTM paradigm, Nexus model

Summary:
This paper documents the development of image captioning models, progressing from a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. Five models are presented, with Nexus being the most advanced, incorporating an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and dynamic attention mechanism. The experiments show the importance of attention mechanisms in enhancing performance, as upgrading the visual backbone alone can degrade results due to the single-vector bottleneck. The findings validate the shift to attention-based models in image captioning tasks. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, the Nexus model achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, outperforming several benchmarks. The work provides a replicable blueprint for understanding core architectural principles in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic, iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

<div> Keywords: human feedback, large language models (LLMs), decomposition principle, user interface, HCI <br />
Summary: 
This study focuses on improving human feedback for aligning large language models using the decomposition principle. By breaking down text into individual claims and building a user interface called DxHF, users can provide more accurate feedback and make quicker judgments. Technical evaluation shows that decomposition enhances feedback accuracy, particularly for users who are uncertain. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants demonstrates that using DxHF increases feedback accuracy by 5% on average, although it slightly lengthens the feedback time. Accuracy is significantly higher when users have less certainty. Overall, the study suggests that leveraging human-computer interaction (HCI) methods can effectively enhance human-AI alignment in tasks involving large language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human preferences are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the current user interfaces require annotators to compare text paragraphs, which is cognitively challenging when the texts are long or unfamiliar. This paper contributes by studying the decomposition principle as an approach to improving the quality of human feedback for LLM alignment. This approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment. Our technical evaluation shows evidence that decomposition generally improves feedback accuracy regarding the ground truth, particularly for users with uncertainty. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants indicates that using DxHF improves feedback accuracy by an average of 5%, although it increases the average feedback time by 18 seconds. Notably, accuracy is significantly higher in situations where users have less certainty. The finding of the study highlights the potential of HCI as an effective method for improving human-AI alignment.

Summary:
MemoCoder is introduced as a multi-agent framework designed to improve code generation in challenging programming tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle. It utilizes a Fixing Knowledge Set to store successful repairs and guide future tasks, with a Mentor Agent overseeing the process by identifying error patterns and refining fixing strategies. The framework outperforms zero-shot prompting and self-repair strategies in three benchmark evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation. Through collaborative problem-solving and persistent learning from past fixes, MemoCoder offers a promising solution for developers relying on AI-assisted tools in code generation tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while requiring fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a generative segmentation model family featuring discrete-time autoregressive and modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code available: https://github.com/biomedia-mira/flow-ssn.

The article introduces a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations around the vertical axis, improving sample efficiency. It utilizes a tri-plane feature representation, projecting 3D features onto three planes with a novel design that ensures equivariance and invariance properties. By combining deformable and steerable convolutions, the model adapts to local object geometry while maintaining equivariance. Equivariant adaptations of state-of-the-art grasp planners, GIGA and IGD, are developed, with a focus on computational efficiency. Analytical justifications and extensive experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating reduced computational and memory costs. The equivariant grasp models based on tri-plane features consistently outperform non-equivariant counterparts, achieving higher performance with minimal additional computational overhead. The approach offers a promising solution for efficient and effective grasp planning in robotics. <div>

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation -- i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones. This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically, we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving higher performance with only a modest computational overhead.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel framework called LIGHT for efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments with sparse rewards. LIGHT combines the use of dense individual rewards with human knowledge integration to guide agents towards efficient exploration. It considers individual action distribution and human expertise preference distribution to design individual intrinsic rewards for each agent. These rewards are based on actionable representational transformation relevant to Q-learning, aligning agents' action preferences with human expertise while maximizing joint action value. The experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms representative baselines in terms of performance and knowledge reusability across various sparse-reward tasks in challenging scenarios. The framework successfully integrates human expertise into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner, providing a more effective solution for exploration in complex problems. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Discrete speech tokenization is a fundamental component in speech codecs. However, in large-scale speech-to-speech systems, the complexity of parallel streams from multiple quantizers and the computational cost of high-time-dimensional codecs pose significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce HH-Codec, a neural codec that achieves extreme compression at 24 tokens per second for 24 kHz audio while relying on single-quantizer inference. Our approach involves a carefully designed Vector Quantization space for Spoken Language Modeling, optimizing compression efficiency while minimizing information loss. Building on this, we propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture (Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio) that leverages dual supervision and progressive training to enhance reconstruction stability and fidelity. HH-Codec achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech reconstruction with an ultra-low bandwidth of 0.3 kbps. We further evaluate its effectiveness in codebook utilization and generative model adaptation, with extensive ablations validating the necessity of each module. HH-Codec is available at https://github.com/opendilab/HH-Codec.

Summary: 
Multilingual large language models (LLMs) show strong cross-linguistic generalization, but medium to low resource languages struggle on benchmarks. Activation patterns in Gemma-2-2B across 10 languages reveal disparities, with medium to low resource languages receiving lower activations in early and deeper layers. Activation-aware fine-tuning through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) results in significant activation gains for languages like Malayalam and Hindi, while maintaining English retention. Benchmark results post fine-tuning demonstrate consistent improvements, emphasizing activation alignment as crucial for enhancing multilingual LLM performance. <div>

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese (zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam (ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns. Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

<div> Keywords: object detection, infrared imagery, robustness, cross-modality, weight-space ensembling

Summary:
Object detection in infrared (IR) imagery is crucial for low-light and nighttime applications, but the lack of large-scale IR datasets leads models to rely on pre-training on RGB images. Fine-tuning on IR data improves accuracy but can compromise robustness under distribution shifts due to the RGB-IR modality gap. To address this challenge, LLVIP-C and FLIR-C benchmarks were introduced by corrupting standard IR datasets to create cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges. The WiSE-OD weight-space ensembling method was proposed to combine knowledge from RGB and IR models, with variants WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$ and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$ enhancing cross-modality and corruption robustness without additional training or inference costs. Evaluation on existing detectors and baselines demonstrated the effectiveness of WiSE-OD in improving robustness in object detection tasks across different modalities and corruption scenarios.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally, to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants: WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or inference cost.

Summary:
- The article introduces a novel multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT) for sticker emotion understanding.
- MGHFT leverages Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers from multiple views using rich textual context.
- A hierarchical fusion strategy is implemented to combine textual context with visual understanding, extracting global and local sticker features at multiple stages.
- Through contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are integrated at different stages of the visual backbone to enhance semantic understanding.
- The proposed text-guided fusion attention mechanism effectively integrates multimodal features, leading to improved sticker emotion recognition performance on public datasets. <div>

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically, inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on 2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4% on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at https://github.com/cccccj-03/MGHFT_ACMMM2025.

<br />Summary: 
This study introduces a novel method that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to improve surface temperature forecasts beyond the short-range period. By utilizing CNN-based post-processing for bias correction and spatial super-resolution on each ensemble member, high-resolution temperature fields are reconstructed from low-resolution NWP outputs to reduce systematic errors. Random errors are minimized through ensemble averaging of the CNN-corrected members. Results show that correcting with CNN before ensemble averaging consistently produces more accurate forecasts. The proposed method, despite using low-resolution ensemble forecasts, outperforms deterministic NWP models in accuracy. This integrated approach offers a practical and scalable solution for enhancing medium-range temperature forecasts, especially beneficial for operational centers with limited computational resources.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day) forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations, the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts, the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable at operational centers with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension. TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with interactive exploration.

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning, allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.

Summary:
Multi-TAG introduces a framework for enhancing mathematical reasoning systems by allowing large language models (LLMs) to concurrently use multiple external tools at each reasoning step. Unlike previous approaches, Multi-TAG does not require finetuning and can work with any LLM backbone. It significantly improves solution robustness and accuracy on challenging math benchmarks like MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. The results show average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones. This approach is promising for developing high-performance math reasoning systems that can handle complex problems requiring precise reasoning over multiple steps. Multi-TAG showcases the effectiveness of leveraging multiple tools for mathematical reasoning within a single framework. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

This study focuses on differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) recurrence classification using a dataset of 383 patients and 16 variables. Initially, 11 machine learning models were tested, with Support Vector Machines achieving the highest accuracy. Feature selection using the Boruta algorithm led to Logistic Regression outperforming other models. However, traditional ML models lack uncertainty quantification, which is critical in clinical decisions. To address this, Bayesian Neural Networks with six different prior distributions were implemented. The BNN model with a Normal 0,10 prior exhibited high accuracies before and after feature selection. This comprehensive framework provides accurate DTC recurrence classification while also incorporating interpretability and uncertainty awareness. <div>

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially, 11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481. To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy 0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection, respectively.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model, GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions. Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model. Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18% switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for digital systems.

arXiv:2507.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

Abstract: Rapid advances in medical imaging technology underscore the critical need for precise and automated image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Existing medical IQA methods, however, struggle to generalize across diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA, the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies, the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training, i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow. In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~ 3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes. Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at 10.5281/zenodo.15836053.

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4 percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

<title>PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns. However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification, generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective prediction.

<title>Distilling a Small Utility-Based Passage Selector to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting further research in this area.

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code review tool and the encouraging results.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility, particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph analysis.

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: Prior research indicates that users prefer assistive technologies whose personalities align with their own. This has sparked interest in automatic personality perception (APP), which aims to predict an individual's perceived personality traits. Previous studies in APP have treated personalities as static traits, independent of context. However, perceived personalities can vary by context and situation as shown in psychological research. In this study, we investigate the relationship between conversational speech and perceived personality for participants engaged in two work situations (a neutral interview and a stressful client interaction). Our key findings are: 1) perceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness, sound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral interactions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful contexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform speaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful interactions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing psychological research.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data, and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting, frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting, few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency, scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600 responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she' pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use. Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

Abstract: Static benchmarks fail to capture LLM vulnerabilities emerging through community experimentation in online forums. We present PrompTrend, a system that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models (LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE) versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models, we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE. Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts. Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by 61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis for VLSI.

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block (GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely, MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80% accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded 75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of 95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work, the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90 million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework, where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/lixinHUST/Gated-Conditional-Diffusion-Model/

Abstract: Resource allocation (RA) is critical to efficient service deployment in Network Function Virtualization (NFV), a transformative networking paradigm. Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing promising potential to address this complexity. However, the lack of a systematic benchmarking framework and thorough analysis hinders the exploration of emerging networks and the development of more robust algorithms while causing inconsistent evaluation. In this paper, we introduce Virne, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for the NFV-RA problem, with a focus on supporting deep RL-based methods. Virne provides customizable simulations for diverse network scenarios, including cloud, edge, and 5G environments. It also features a modular and extensible implementation pipeline that supports over 30 methods of various types, and includes practical evaluation perspectives beyond effectiveness, such as scalability, generalization, and scalability. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions. Overall, with its diverse simulations, rich implementations, and extensive evaluation capabilities, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications.

Abstract: This paper contributes to the Alpay Algebra by demonstrating that the stable outcome of a self referential process, obtained by iterating a transformation through all ordinal stages, is identical to the unique equilibrium of an unbounded revision dialogue between a system and its environment. The analysis initially elucidates how classical fixed point theorems guarantee such convergence in finite settings and subsequently extends the argument to the transfinite domain, relying upon well founded induction and principles of order theoretic continuity.
  Furthermore, the resulting transordinal fixed point operator is embedded into dependent type theory, a formalization which permits every step of the transfinite iteration and its limit to be verified within a modern proof assistant. This procedure yields a machine checked proof that the iterative dialogue necessarily stabilizes and that its limit is unique. The result provides a foundation for Alpay's philosophical claim of semantic convergence within the framework of constructive logic. By unifying concepts from fixed point theory, game semantics, ordinal analysis, and type theory, this research establishes a broadly accessible yet formally rigorous foundation for reasoning about infinite self referential systems and offers practical tools for certifying their convergence within computational environments.

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences, allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE, quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head, we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page: https://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.

Abstract: In contrast to single-user recommender systems, group recommender systems are designed to generate and explain recommendations for groups. This group-oriented setting introduces additional complexities, as several factors - absent in individual contexts - must be addressed. These include understanding group dynamics (e.g., social dependencies within the group), defining effective decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are suitable for all group members, and providing group-level explanations as well as explanations for individual users. In this paper, we analyze in which way large language models (LLMs) can support these aspects and help to increase the overall decision support quality and applicability of group recommender systems.

Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology, flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However, effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation on the challenging KITTI Object Detection Benchmark using public testing server at https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object_detail.php?&amp;result=d162ec699d6992040e34314d19ab7f5c217075e0 establishes the efficacy of our method by achieving new state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in different categories while remaining among the most efficient methods. Our code will be released through MuStD GitHub repository at https://github.com/IbrahimUWA/MuStD.git

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision. Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent. InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet, but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability of prototype-based explanations.

<title>Doubling Your Data in Minutes: Ultra-fast Tabular Data Generation via LLM-Induced Dependency Graphs</title>

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

<title>Smooth Reading: Bridging the Gap of Recurrent LLM to Self-Attention LLM on Long-Context Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19353</link>

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from 5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench. Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further progress, we will release code and dataset.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning, shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments, and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks (\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks. Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection depends on user priorities.

<title>Counterfactual Explanations in Medical Imaging: Exploring SPN-Guided Latent Space Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications. By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks (SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction (GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&amp;I Corpus, the first publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation evolve rapidly through fine-tuning, merging, or new model releases. However, such updates can introduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and performance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing framework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two LLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution performance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update scenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with cross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with general-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to 18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance degradation in execution time versus GPT-4o. Overall, logical correctness, performance, and error handling (e.g., syntax errors and missing imports) are the most regression-prone areas. Comparing ReCatcher with baseline solutions, it presents better and consistent accuracy across logical and performance aspects. ReCatcher highlights the importance of systematic regression evaluation before adopting new models, while assisting researchers and practitioners in making more informed update decisions.

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from previous SOTA models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities, substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes explicitly malicious ("direct") and plausibly benign ("indirect") prompt variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools (e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.

Abstract: Connected and software-defined vehicles promise to offer a broad range of services and advanced functions to customers, aiming to increase passenger comfort and support autonomous driving capabilities. Due to the high reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.
  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime. Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely causes.
  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an early stage.

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning models that describe the data equally well but may produce different predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used. In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice; predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities, including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset with audio-based representation.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology, aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.

Abstract: Designed to track changes in students' knowledge status and predict their future answers based on students' historical answer records. Current research on KT modeling focuses on predicting future student performance based on existing, unupdated records of student learning interactions. However, these methods ignore distractions in the response process (such as slipping and guessing) and ignore that static cognitive representations are temporary and limited. Most of them assume that there are no distractions during the answering process, and that the recorded representation fully represents the student's understanding and proficiency in knowledge. This can lead to many dissonant and uncoordinated issues in the original record. Therefore, we propose a knowledge-tracking cognitive representation optimization (CRO-KT) model that uses dynamic programming algorithms to optimize the structure of cognitive representation. This ensures that the structure matches the student's cognitive patterns in terms of practice difficulty. In addition, we use a synergistic optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representation of sub-target exercises based on the overall picture of exercise responses by considering all exercises with synergistic relationships as one goal. At the same time, the CRO-KT model integrates the relationship embedding learned in the dichotomous graph with the optimized record representation in a weighted manner, which enhances students' cognitive expression ability. Finally, experiments were conducted on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive representation optimization model.

Abstract: AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This position paper presents a design of the Super Agent System powered by the hybrid AI routers. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.

Abstract: Accurately identifying synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical bottleneck in materials research, as translating literature-derived knowledge into actionable insights is hindered by the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of scientific texts. Here we present MOFh6, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to extract, structure, and apply synthesis knowledge from diverse input formats, including raw literature and crystal codes. Built on gpt-4o-mini and fine-tuned with up to few-shot expert-annotated data, MOFh6 achieves 99% accuracy in synthesis data parsing and resolves 94.1% of complex co-reference abbreviations. It processes a single full-text document in 9.6 seconds and localizes structured synthesis descriptions within 36 seconds, with the cost per 100 papers reduced to USD 4.24, a 76% saving over existing systems. By addressing long-standing limitations in cross-paragraph semantic fusion and terminology standardization, MOFh6 reshapes the LLM-based paradigm for MOF synthesis research, transforming static retrieval into an integrated and dynamic knowledge acquisition process. This shift bridges the gap between scientific literature and actionable synthesis design, providing a scalable framework for accelerating materials discovery.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level GoogleProof Q&amp;A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o. Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%) outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more robust, trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Ensuring clinical data privacy while preserving utility is critical for AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID) methods, including rule-based techniques, deep learning models, and large language models (LLMs), often suffer from recall errors, limited generalization, and inefficiencies, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a fully automated, multi-modal framework, RedactOR for de-identifying structured and unstructured electronic health records, including clinical audio records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular architecture of RedactOR and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights from deployment in real-world AI- driven healthcare data pipelines.

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling, especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings, we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues. We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23% in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality. The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39% shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

Abstract: Loss spikes often occur during pre-training of large language models. The spikes degrade the performance of large language models and sometimes ruin the pre-training. Since the pre-training needs a vast computational budget, we should avoid such spikes. Based on the assumption that the loss spike is caused by the sudden growth of the gradient norm, we explore factors to keep the gradient norm small through an analysis of the spectral norms of the Jacobian matrices for the sub-layers. Our findings suggest that stabilizing the pre-training process requires two conditions: small sub-layers and large shortcut. We conduct various experiments to empirically verify our theoretical analyses. Experimental results demonstrate that methods satisfying the conditions effectively prevent loss spikes during pre-training.

Abstract: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources.

Abstract: Clinical decision support systems require models that are not only highly accurate but also equitable and sensitive to the implications of missed diagnoses. In this study, we introduce a knowledge-guided in-context learning (ICL) framework designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively process structured clinical data. Our approach integrates domain-specific feature groupings, carefully balanced few-shot examples, and task-specific prompting strategies. We systematically evaluate this method across seventy distinct ICL designs by various prompt variations and two different communication styles-natural-language narrative and numeric conversational-and compare its performance to robust classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks on tasks involving heart disease and diabetes prediction.
  Our findings indicate that while traditional ML models maintain superior performance in balanced precision-recall scenarios, LLMs employing narrative prompts with integrated domain knowledge achieve higher recall and significantly reduce gender bias, effectively narrowing fairness disparities by an order of magnitude. Despite the current limitation of increased inference latency, LLMs provide notable advantages, including the capacity for zero-shot deployment and enhanced equity. This research offers the first comprehensive analysis of ICL design considerations for applying LLMs to tabular clinical tasks and highlights distillation and multimodal extensions as promising directions for future research.

Abstract: We introduce a class of neural networks named PLEIADES (PoLynomial Expansion In Adaptive Distributed Event-based Systems), which contains temporal convolution kernels generated from orthogonal polynomial basis functions. We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.

Abstract: Controllable generative models for images and videos have seen significant success, yet 3D scene generation, especially in unbounded scenarios like autonomous driving, remains underdeveloped. Existing methods lack flexible controllability and often rely on dense view data collection in controlled environments, limiting their generalizability across common datasets (e.g., nuScenes). In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel framework for controllable 3D street scene generation that combines video-based view synthesis with 3D representation (3DGS) generation. It supports multi-condition control, including road maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous approaches that require 3D representation before training, MagicDrive3D first trains a multi-view video generation model to synthesize diverse street views. This method utilizes routinely collected autonomous driving data, reducing data acquisition challenges and enriching 3D scene generation. In the 3DGS generation step, we introduce Fault-Tolerant Gaussian Splatting to address minor errors and use monocular depth for better initialization, alongside appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Experiments show that MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes, supports any-view rendering, and enhances downstream tasks like BEV segmentation, demonstrating its potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond.

Abstract: Recent LLMs are able to generate high-quality multilingual texts, indistinguishable for humans from authentic human-written ones. Research in machine-generated text detection is however mostly focused on the English language and longer texts, such as news articles, scientific papers or student essays. Social-media texts are usually much shorter and often feature informal language, grammatical errors, or distinct linguistic items (e.g., emoticons, hashtags). There is a gap in studying the ability of existing methods in detection of such texts, reflected also in the lack of existing multilingual benchmark datasets. To fill this gap we propose the first multilingual (22 languages) and multi-platform (5 social media platforms) dataset for benchmarking machine-generated text detection in the social-media domain, called MultiSocial. It contains 472,097 texts, of which about 58k are human-written and approximately the same amount is generated by each of 7 multilingual LLMs. We use this benchmark to compare existing detection methods in zero-shot as well as fine-tuned form. Our results indicate that the fine-tuned detectors have no problem to be trained on social-media texts and that the platform selection for training matters.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in image segmentation and object detection, understanding complex scenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

Abstract: The broadcasting industry has adopted IP technologies, revolutionising both live and pre-recorded content production, from news gathering to live music events. IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These could include adding sound effects to automated closed captioning or identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of generative AI and multimodal technology, allowing wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

Abstract: Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models. Our model and a subset of the data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Team-ACE.

<title>ObjectRelator: Enabling Cross-View Object Relation Understanding Across Ego-Centric and Exo-Centric Perspectives</title>

arXiv:2411.19083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between ego-centric and exo-centric views has been a long-standing question in computer vision. In this paper, we focus on the emerging Ego-Exo object correspondence task, which aims to understand object relations across ego-exo perspectives through segmentation. While numerous segmentation models have been proposed, most operate on a single image (view), making them impractical for cross-view scenarios. PSALM, a recently proposed segmentation method, stands out as a notable exception with its demonstrated zero-shot ability on this task. However, due to the drastic viewpoint change between ego and exo, PSALM fails to accurately locate and segment objects, especially in complex backgrounds or when object appearances change significantly. To address these issues, we propose ObjectRelator, a novel approach featuring two key modules: Multimodal Condition Fusion (MCFuse) and SSL-based Cross-View Object Alignment (XObjAlign). MCFuse introduces language as an additional cue, integrating both visual masks and textual descriptions to improve object localization and prevent incorrect associations. XObjAlign enforces cross-view consistency through self-supervised alignment, enhancing robustness to object appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate ObjectRelator's effectiveness on the large-scale Ego-Exo4D benchmark and HANDAL-X (an adapted dataset for cross-view segmentation) with state-of-the-art performance. Code is made available at: http://yuqianfu.com/ObjectRelator.

<title>Tell Me What to Track: Infusing Robust Language Guidance for Enhanced Referring Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to localize an arbitrary number of targets based on a language expression and continuously track them in a video. This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

<title>Evaluation of LLM Vulnerabilities to Being Misused for Personalized Disinformation Generation</title>

Abstract: The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts raises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluating vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward domains, many environment steps are required to observe reward information. In order to increase the frequency of such observations, "potential-based reward shaping" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required "potential function" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a "bootstrapped" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite.

<title>FrameFusion: Combining Similarity and Importance for Video Token Reduction on Large Vision Language Models</title>

arXiv:2501.01986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand to process long and high-resolution videos significantly burdens Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the enormous number of visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%. Our code is available at: https://github.com/thu-nics/FrameFusion.

Abstract: An approach to improve neural network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We define a measure for clusterability and show that pre-trained models form highly enmeshed clusters via spectral graph clustering. We thus train models to be more modular using a "clusterability loss" function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. We then investigate the emerging properties of these highly clustered models. We find our trained clustered models do not exhibit more task specialization, but do form smaller circuits. We investigate CNNs trained on MNIST and CIFAR, small transformers trained on modular addition, and GPT-2 and Pythia on the Wiki dataset, and Gemma on a Chemistry dataset. This investigation shows what to expect from clustered models.

<title>Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities</title>

arXiv:2502.05209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.

Abstract: Offline preference alignment for language models such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is favored for its effectiveness and simplicity, eliminating the need for costly reinforcement learning. Various offline algorithms have been developed for different data settings, yet they lack a unified understanding.
  In this study, we introduce Pior-Informed Preference Alignment (PIPA), a unified, RL-free probabilistic framework that formulates language model preference alignment as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem with prior constraints. This method effectively accommodates both paired and unpaired data, as well as answer and step-level annotations. We illustrate that DPO and KTO are special cases with different prior constraints within our framework. By integrating different types of prior information, we developed two variations of PIPA: PIPA-M and PIPA-N. Both algorithms demonstrate a $3\sim10\%$ performance enhancement on the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks across all configurations, achieving these gains without additional training or computational costs compared to existing algorithms.

arXiv:2502.08606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings mitigate the risks associated with large-scale distillation by enabling compute-optimal allocation for both the teacher and student to maximize student performance. We provide compute-optimal distillation recipes for two key scenarios: when a teacher already exists, and when a teacher needs training. In settings involving many students or an existing teacher, distillation outperforms supervised learning up to a compute level that scales predictably with student size. Conversely, if only one student is to be distilled and a teacher also requires training, supervised learning is generally preferable. Additionally, our large-scale study of distillation increases our understanding of the process and helps inform experimental design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in automated code generation. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on pre-defined test cases, which become impractical in scenarios where such cases are unavailable. While prior works explore filtering techniques between programs and test cases, they overlook the refinement of test cases. To address this limitation, we introduce CoCoEvo, a novel LLM-based co-evolution framework that simultaneously evolves programs and test cases. CoCoEvo eliminates the dependency on pre-defined test cases by generating both programs and test cases directly from natural language problem descriptions and function headers. The framework employs specialized evolutionary operators, including LLM-based crossover and mutation operators for program evolution, along with an additional test case generation operator for test case evolution. Additionally, we propose optimization strategies such as a crossover rate scheduler to balance exploration and convergence, and a multi-objective optimization method for test case selection. Experimental results on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that CoCoEvo surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in automated code generation and testing. These results underscore the potential of co-evolutionary techniques in advancing the field of automated programming.

arXiv:2502.11439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is an important step in adapting foundation models such as large language models to downstream tasks. To make this step more accessible to users with limited computational budgets, it is crucial to develop fine-tuning methods that are memory and computationally efficient. Sparse Fine-tuning (SpFT) and Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are two frameworks that have emerged for addressing this problem and have been adopted widely in practice. In this work, we develop a new SpFT framework, based on ideas from neural network pruning. At a high level, we first identify ``important'' neurons/nodes using feature importance metrics from network pruning (specifically, we use the structural pruning method), and then perform fine-tuning by restricting to weights involving these neurons. Experiments on common language tasks show our method improves SpFT's memory efficiency by 20-50\% while matching the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods like LoRA's variants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.

<title>Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer</title>

arXiv:2502.20719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, ensuring their cultural sensitivity and inclusivity is paramount. We introduce our dataset, a year-long community-driven project covering all 22 Arab countries. The dataset includes instructions (input, response pairs) in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), spanning 20 diverse topics. Built by a team of 44 researchers across the Arab world, all of whom are authors of this paper, our dataset offers a broad, inclusive perspective. We use our dataset to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations. For instance, while closed-source LLMs generally exhibit strong performance, they are not without flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Moreover, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen). Our annotation guidelines, code, and data for reproducibility are publicly available.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.

Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation is crucial for handling objects that are too thin, large, or otherwise ungraspable in unstructured environments. While conventional planning-based approaches struggle with complex contact modeling, learning-based methods have recently emerged as a promising alternative. However, existing learning-based approaches face two major limitations: they heavily rely on multi-view cameras and precise pose tracking, and they fail to generalize across varying physical conditions, such as changes in object mass and table friction. To address these challenges, we propose the Dynamics-Adaptive World Action Model (DyWA), a novel framework that enhances action learning by jointly predicting future states while adapting to dynamics variations based on historical trajectories. By unifying the modeling of geometry, state, physics, and robot actions, DyWA enables more robust policy learning under partial observability. Compared to baselines, our method improves the success rate by 31.5% using only single-view point cloud observations in the simulation. Furthermore, DyWA achieves an average success rate of 68% in real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse object geometries, adapt to varying table friction, and robustness in challenging scenarios such as half-filled water bottles and slippery surfaces.

<title>Maximum Redundancy Pruning: A Principle-Driven Layerwise Sparsity Allocation for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but their enormous size poses significant challenges for deployment in real-world applications. To address this issue, researchers have sought to apply network pruning techniques to LLMs. A critical challenge in pruning is allocation the sparsity for each layer. Recent sparsity allocation methods is often based on heuristics or search that can easily lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we conducted an extensive investigation into various LLMs and revealed three significant discoveries: (1) the layerwise pruning sensitivity (LPS) of LLMs is highly non-uniform, (2) the choice of pruning metric affects LPS, and (3) the performance of a sparse model is related to the uniformity of its layerwise redundancy level. Based on these observations, we propose that the layerwise sparsity of LLMs should adhere to three principles: \emph{non-uniformity}, \emph{pruning metric dependency}, and \emph{uniform layerwise redundancy level} in the pruned model. To this end, we proposed Maximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), an iterative pruning algorithm that prunes in the most redundant layers (\emph{i.e.}, those with the highest non-outlier ratio) at each iteration. The achieved layerwise sparsity aligns with the outlined principles. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available LLMs, including the LLaMA2 and OPT, across various benchmarks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of MRP, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods.

<title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>

Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, the standard minor-embedding technique in the quantum annealing literature, provided by D-Wave. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we evaluate Minorminer's embedding capabilities, the quality and robustness of its embeddings, and its execution-time performance. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, suggesting that more effective embedding strategies could lead to meaningful gains in quantum annealing performance.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN) training paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings. However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\% and 12.7\%, and saves at maximum 86\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: The growing popularity of large language models has raised concerns regarding the potential to misuse AI-generated text (AIGT). It becomes increasingly critical to establish an excellent AIGT detection method with high generalization and robustness. However, existing methods either focus on model generalization or concentrate on robustness. The unified mechanism, to simultaneously address the challenges of generalization and robustness, is less explored. In this paper, we argue that robustness can be view as a specific form of domain shift, and empirically reveal an intrinsic mechanism for model generalization of AIGT detection task. Then, we proposed a novel AIGT detection method (DP-Net) via dynamic perturbations introduced by a reinforcement learning with elaborated reward and action. Experimentally, extensive results show that the proposed DP-Net significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art AIGT detection methods for generalization capacity in three cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, the DP-Net achieves best robustness under two text adversarial attacks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/AIGT-Detection-Evade-Detection/tree/main/DP-Net.

Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as ``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models (LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research.

<title>Toward Structured Knowledge Reasoning: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience</title>

arXiv:2506.00842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical bridge architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for molecule discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model (BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher than the classical baseline, while reducing parameter count by more than 60%. Key findings favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically-grounded architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 73.2%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight. This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification, enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas, demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.

<title>Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization</title>

arXiv:2506.19256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2) learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution, SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.

<title>Interaction-Merged Motion Planning: Effectively Leveraging Diverse Motion Datasets for Robust Planning</title>

arXiv:2507.04790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding, but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation. We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable and practical solution for 3D understanding.

arXiv:2507.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback, they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants: standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN (H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to 5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048 tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5, despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing domain-specific information.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.

<title>SE-VLN: A Self-Evolving Vision-Language Navigation Framework Based on Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

<title>$S^2M^2$: Scalable Stereo Matching Model for Reliable Depth Estimation</title>

arXiv:2507.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.

arXiv:2507.13618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

<div> Symbolic Regression, Fluid Mechanics, Incompressible Flow, PySR Library, Answer Set Programming

Summary:
Symbolic Regression (SR) is utilized to model a 3D incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, providing interpretable mathematical relationships without prior assumptions. The study focuses on velocity and pressure fields, deriving compact equations from numerical simulations using the PySR library. The resulting equations accurately depict the flow dynamics, matching analytical solutions and showcasing SR's ability to simplify complex behaviors. An innovative hybrid approach combining SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) ensures generated equations are both statistically accurate and physically plausible, aligning with domain principles. This integration enhances the reliability of data-driven models and paves the way for efficient frameworks in real-time data analysis, emphasizing the importance of explainable predictions in fluid mechanics. <div>

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as "black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems, requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible, adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise, interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA (Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications. An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation.

<div> Timeline-based planning, qualitative temporal constraints, synchronization rules, PSPACE-complete, deterministic fragment

Summary:
Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as collections of independent components with interactions governed by qualitative temporal constraints known as synchronization rules. The plan-existence problem is PSPACE-complete and has been shown to be reducible to the nonemptiness problem of nondeterministic finite automata. However, using nondeterministic automata for planning strategy synthesis requires a costly determinization step. This paper introduces a fragment of timeline-based planning that directly maps the plan-existence problem to the nonemptiness problem of deterministic finite automata, enabling strategy synthesis. The research also identifies a maximal subset of Allen's relations that can be accommodated in this deterministic fragment. The deterministic fragment simplifies the planning process by eliminating the need for determinization, offering a more efficient approach to qualitative timeline-based planning.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent, but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback. Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts, semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to 1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4% improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a 4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment (CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones (3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned creative AI.

Summary: 
Charts and graphs are traditionally used by humans to analyze data, but recent experiments with commercial vision-language models, GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5, have shown that AI systems can also benefit from visualization. Through a series of experiments involving synthetic datasets, it was found that the AI systems provided more precise and accurate descriptions when accompanied by a scatterplot, particularly as datasets became more complex. Comparison with baseline scenarios of a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data confirmed that the charts' content was responsible for the improved performance. This initial evidence suggests that AI systems, like humans, can gain insights and make better analyses when presented with visual representations of data.

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot, especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines -- providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

Summary: 
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces challenges like partial observability and limited communication, leading to the dominance of Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE). However, existing CTDE methods often do not fully utilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees. The proposed Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization (MAGPO) framework integrates centralized guidance with decentralized execution, using an auto-regressive joint policy for efficient exploration. MAGPO aligns this joint policy with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability. The framework provides theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement. Empirical evaluations on various tasks show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and can match or even surpass fully centralized approaches. Overall, MAGPO offers a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning, enhancing performance in diverse environments. <div>

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution. MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across 6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity, creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch, the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research (ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000 GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art (SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for self-accelerating AI systems.

An Agentic AI framework is introduced to automate the clinical data pipeline in healthcare, addressing the challenges of fragmented workflows, model compatibility issues, and data privacy constraints. The framework consists of modular agents that handle structured and unstructured data, automating feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing. Evaluation on geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework. The pipeline includes agents for file-type detection, data anonymization, feature extraction, model-data feature matching, preprocessing recommendation, and model inference. By reducing the need for manual intervention, the framework offers a cost-efficient pathway for implementing AI in clinical environments. The use of interpretable outputs further enhances the transparency and usability of the system in healthcare settings. <div>

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular, task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Summary:<br /><br />The study focuses on the importance of post-licensure surveillance systems for COVID-19 vaccines due to limited safety data collection during clinical trials. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Active Learning to develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety issues from Emergency Department (ED) notes. ED triage notes provide vital patient information and can aid in timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. NLP is a more accurate and efficient alternative to keyword-based classification, although it requires annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation. This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert, succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data, which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance. This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

<div> graph neural networks, mean aggregation, ratio modal logic, expressive power, uniform setting

Summary:
Graph neural networks with mean aggregation have the same expressive power as ratio modal logic in the non-uniform setting. This places them between max aggregation and sum aggregation in terms of expressive power. In the uniform setting, mean GNNs relative to MSO are equivalent to alternation-free modal logic, assuming continuous combination functions and threshold classification functions. This shows that mean GNNs are less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs in the uniform setting. Dropping these assumptions can increase the expressive power of mean GNNs. <div>
arXiv:2507.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power increases.

<div> Keywords: large language models, cognition attribution framework, knowledge retrieval, reasoning adjustment, parameter scaling<br />
Summary:<br />
1. The study introduces a cognition attribution framework to dissect the contributions of knowledge and reasoning in large language models (LLMs), inspired by dual-system cognitive theory.
2. LLM cognition is divided into knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2), assessed through fast and slow thinking modes.
3. Results indicate that reasoning adjustment varies by domain, benefitting reasoning-focused areas like mathematics, physics, and chemistry while potentially hindering knowledge-centric fields.
4. Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with a greater impact on knowledge enhancement.
5. Knowledge is predominantly housed in lower network layers, while reasoning activities occur in higher layers, revealing insights into LLM architecture and behavior.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

<div> semantics, disjunction, Answer Set Programming, Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models
Summary:
The paper compares four different semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that do not follow the principle of model minimality. Two approaches, Justified Models and Strongly Supported Models, offer alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. Two other approaches, Forks and Determining Inference (DI) semantics, introduce a new disjunction connective. It is shown that Forks, Justified Models, and a relaxed version of DI semantics coincide and form a single approach. This common semantics always includes stable models and is stronger than Strongly Supported Models, which treat disjunctions classically. The research establishes that these approaches work similarly under different definitions, providing a broader understanding of disjunction in answer set programming.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two, Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference} (DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide, constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover, this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in classical logic.

<div> Keywords: qualitative risk assessment, AI, EU AI Act, legal compliance, fundamental rights protection

Summary: 
The chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk assessment of AI, particularly within the EU AI Act context. It addresses the complexities of legal compliance and protection of fundamental rights by incorporating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning. Definitional balancing utilizes proportionality analysis to resolve conflicting rights, while defeasible reasoning adapts to the evolving legal landscape. The framework emphasizes the need for analyzing AI deployment scenarios to identify potential legal breaches and impacts on fundamental rights. It establishes philosophical foundations for a logical AI risk analysis by considering the interaction between AI scenarios and rights. The approach supports the evaluation of high-risk AI systems and General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems. Future work aims to develop formal models and algorithms to enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theory with practical applications for responsible AI governance.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning. Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights, incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications to support responsible AI governance.

Summary: 
Automatically marking Physics exams is a challenging task addressed in this study. The approach involves using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver, and a term rewriting system to assess typed student answers for correctness compared to a ground truth solution. A Large Language Model is utilized to interpret and correct errors in student responses before converting them into a machine-readable format. Two automated theorem proving methods are applied: off-the-shelf SMT solving and a specialized term rewriting system for physics problems involving trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system required establishing termination and confluence properties, discussed in detail in the paper. The system's performance is evaluated on a dataset of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format. Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990 multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic deployment of LLMs in finance.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a theoretical framework called IB-aware Reasoning Optimization (IBRO) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework is grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle and aims to incentivize LLMs to produce informative and generalizable reasoning trajectories. By introducing IB regularization, which is a lightweight technique that seamlessly integrates into existing reinforcement learning-based post-training frameworks, the authors demonstrate consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and reinforcement learning algorithms. The approach is designed to encourage reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts, leading to more principled and effective methodologies for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning methods are applied to optimize call routing in call centres to minimize client waiting time and staff idle time. Two approaches are compared: a model-based method using Value Iteration with known system dynamics and a model-free approach using Proximal Policy Optimization learning from experience. A theoretical and simulation model is used to frame the problem as a Markov Decision Process within a Skills-Based Routing framework. The simulation model combines Discrete Event Simulation with OpenAI Gym environment. Random, Value Iteration, and Proximal Policy Optimization policies are evaluated using the simulation model. Despite longer training time, Proximal Policy Optimization consistently achieves the highest rewards, lowest client waiting time, and staff idle time across 1,000 test episodes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time, despite requiring longer training time.

Summary:
The paper discusses Constraint Programming within Logic Programming and the use of Prolog systems for handling constraint programming on finite domains. It focuses on the table constraint, which specifies conditions on variable values as an enumeration of options. The Compact-Table algorithm, a propagation algorithm for Table constraints, is enhanced by leveraging the computational power of GPUs to handle large constraints efficiently. The paper describes the design and implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, its integration into existing constraint solvers, and presents experimental validation on a significant number of instances. This approach addresses real-world problems with a large number of cases that standard CPU-based approaches struggle to handle effectively. The enhanced CT algorithm provides a more efficient solution for handling Table constraints, making it a valuable contribution to the field of Constraint Programming. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties; nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver. This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant set of instances.

- Concept probing helps interpret artificial neural networks by mapping their internal representations to human-defined concepts.
- Research has focused on the model being probed and the probing model, neglecting the importance of training data for probing models.
- This paper investigates the impact of different training data on the performance of probing models in image classification tasks.
- The study also provides concept labels for two commonly used datasets.
- By addressing the gap in understanding the role of training data in concept probing, this research advances the field of interpretabilty in artificial neural networks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap. Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces a novel framework called the Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF) to improve Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER). Two key modules are designed to enhance time-frequency modeling and balance optimization.

The Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) dynamically balances classification and contrastive losses for more stable representation learning. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that HDF significantly improves recognition accuracy and robustness, outperforming existing methods. The proposed framework achieves superior results in weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization in diverse and imbalanced scenarios.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design, improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then, based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses, enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Summary:
Effective communication strategies among Large Language Model (LLM) agents are crucial for collaborative problem-solving in AI-aided education. This study evaluates four communication modes - teacher-student interaction, peer-to-peer collaboration, reciprocal peer teaching, and critical debate - in a dual-agent mathematical problem-solving environment using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. Results from the study show that dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with peer-to-peer collaboration being the most effective in achieving high accuracy. Dialogue acts such as statements, acknowledgment, and hints play a significant role in enhancing problem-solving efficiency. The study highlights the importance of effective communication strategies in tackling complex problems in AI education, emphasizing that while multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, the quality of communication is essential for successful problem-solving in educational settings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes, \textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration}, \textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements, acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving. While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI education.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540 clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63) of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n = 66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally, we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient, high-quality care.

<div> cognitive biases, diagnostic reasoning, scenario-based learning, personalized support, instructional sequence

Summary:
This study explores the effectiveness of personalized support in improving diagnostic reasoning skills among students. It focuses on the optimal sequencing of instructional activities in scenario-based learning (SBL) to address cognitive biases like premature closure and heuristic reliance. The research compares two approaches: providing diagnostic strategy instruction before (I-PS) and after (PS-I) problem-solving tasks in an online SBL environment called PharmaSim. Results show that both instruction types are beneficial, but PS-I results in significantly higher performance in transfer tasks. This suggests that incorporating explicit diagnostic strategy instruction after problem-solving activities can enhance learning and its application in real-world scenarios. The findings highlight the importance of personalized support in developing effective diagnostic reasoning skills, particularly in educational environments like pharmacy technician apprenticeships. The study contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve students' ability to overcome cognitive biases and make sound diagnostic decisions.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics. Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc. In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer, synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce small-word deletion errors.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, Priority-Based) to address the communication cost bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL). The aim is to reduce unnecessary model update transmissions by selectively forwarding significant updates, thereby lowering bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets demonstrate that intelligent caching improves scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks, making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other latency-sensitive applications.

Summary: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a shift towards human-AI co-creation in early-stage design processes. This new paradigm challenges traditional workflows by integrating AI as a collaborative partner rather than a mere tool for automation. Large language models like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion are used as creative agents to engage designers in iterative cycles of proposal, critique, and revision. By actively participating in ideation, visual conceptualization, and decision-making, AI transforms from a back-end computational tool to an interactive collaborator in design processes. This innovative approach not only enhances efficiency but also fosters a new level of creative exploration and problem-solving in human-centered design. <div>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve from a back-end computational tool into an interactive, generative collaborator, its integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles of proposal, critique, and revision.

Summary: 
- This study compared the performance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) in binary classification of toxicological assay activation.
- GINs consistently outperformed GCNs and GATs in data-abundant environments, while GATs were more optimal for data-scarce environments.
- Optimized GNNs achieved AUC scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 across different assays.
- GCNs and GATs reached closer optimized states with each other compared to GINs in higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.
- The study highlights the unique implications of different GNN architectures in AI-driven cheminformatics and provides insights on the most suitable GNN for varying data abundance scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7 different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint, to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other, compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN algorithm.

Summary:
In a recent paper by Kit Fine, significant findings were presented regarding the logical properties of first-order ignorance, second-order ignorance, and Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Fine's analysis revealed that Rumsfeld ignorance could be defined in terms of ignorance, leading to trivial results and an easily solvable axiomatization problem due to identical accessibility relations for the implicit knowledge operator in both ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance. To address this issue, the study assumes distinct accessibility relations, ensuring one is a subset of the other. This approach eliminates the definability problem while preserving previous valid results and leading to axiomatizations across various proper bi-frame classes. Lastly, the framework is applied to analyze Fine's original results, showcasing its practical application and efficacy in studying logical properties related to ignorance concepts.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

The article presents four open conjectures in graph theory generated by an automated conjecturing system called TxGraffiti. These conjectures are concise, grounded in natural graph invariants, and have been empirically validated across hundreds of graphs. Despite extensive efforts, they remain unresolved, posing mathematical challenges that defy both proof and counterexample. The conjectures are products of symbolic pattern recognition and mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue. By highlighting these problems, the article aims to inspire both human mathematicians and AI systems to engage with them, not only to solve them but also to reflect on the involvement of machines in the creative process of mathematical thought.

Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of mathematical thought.

Summary:
Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets have shown remarkable success in various tasks but face limitations in representational capacity, adaptability, and scalability. This raises the question of whether Euclidean geometry is the best inductive bias for all models, prompting exploration of alternative geometric spaces like hyperbolic spaces. These non-Euclidean manifolds offer lower-dimensional embeddings of hierarchical structures and power-law distributions, improving reasoning processes in foundation models. Recent advancements have utilized hyperbolic neural networks to enhance complex reasoning, zero-shot generalization, and semantic alignment across modalities while maintaining efficiency. The paper reviews the use of hyperbolic spaces in foundation models and highlights challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes? Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

<title>Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking</title>

<div> Keywords: LLMs, position bias, repetition consistency, dynamic early-stopping, confidence-based adaptation

Summary:
LLMs are affected by position bias, leading to varying rankings based on candidate orderings. Low repetition consistency further complicates the issue. A common solution is to prompt LLMs multiple times and aggregate results, but this increases computational costs. The severity of position bias varies greatly across instances, necessitating a per-instance mitigation strategy. A dynamic early-stopping method is introduced to adaptively determine the number of repetitions needed for each instance, reducing LLM calls by an average of 81% without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, a confidence-based adaptation further decreases LLM calls by 87% compared to static repetition, with a minor accuracy trade-off. Experimentation on three LLMs of different sizes and two tasks, re-ranking, and alignment, validates the efficiency and effectiveness of the dynamic repetition strategy in mitigating position bias and low repetition consistency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers, the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias. Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt -- and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of 81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of 87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off relative to our original early-stopping method.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset, SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions, achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics, with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Summary:<br /><br />Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) used in AI-enabled healthcare research are being tested for clinical validation. However, they are susceptible to learning non-biological technical features, such as variations in surgical techniques and laboratory procedures, posing risks for clinical deployment. A new benchmark called PathoROB was developed to assess FM robustness, revealing deficits in all evaluated FMs and the potential for diagnostic errors and clinical blunders. Using more robust FMs and implementing post-hoc robustification can reduce the risk of errors but not completely eliminate them. This work highlights the importance of evaluating FM robustness before clinical adoption and emphasizes the need for future FM development to prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.<div>

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, GraphEXT, explainability, cooperative game theory, social externalities
<br />
Summary: 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown high performance in graph-related tasks but lack explainability due to their black-box nature. Existing methods struggle to capture node interaction patterns effectively. GraphEXT, a novel explainability framework, uses cooperative game theory and social externalities to decompose the graph into subgraphs based on node coalitions. By considering graph structure as an externality and using the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as nodes move between coalitions. Unlike traditional methods focusing on node attributes, GraphEXT emphasizes node interactions and structural changes' impact on GNN predictions. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate GraphEXT's superior fidelity in explaining GNN models across different architectures. Overall, GraphEXT significantly enhances GNN explainability by highlighting node interactions and structural influences.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Detail++, a training-free framework for text-to-image generation that utilizes Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) to address challenges with complex prompts. Inspired by the human drawing process, Detail++ breaks down complex prompts into simplified sub-prompts to guide the generation process in stages, ensuring global composition before refining details. Cross-attention mechanisms are used for accurate binding between attributes and subjects, with a Centroid Alignment Loss introduced to enhance attribute consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic conditions.

Summary:  
Recent advancements in Deep Learning have shown promise for revolutionizing skin cancer screenings like Melanoma, especially when applied at the edge. However, inherent biases in these systems pose potential dangers. Ensuring fairness in these systems is crucial, particularly in evaluating how well they represent various demographics and minority groups. This study uses the LightningDiT model to assess the fairness of melanoma classifiers, indicating that using realistic synthetic data shows promise for fairness assessment. Challenges arise when the evaluation model differs from the training data, complicating fairness verification. Despite these challenges, leveraging synthetic data can offer a valuable approach for enhancing fairness in medical imaging GenAI systems. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age, and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge, this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images. Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI systems.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the use of reinforcement learning techniques to enhance decoding performance of linear block codes. It outlines a methodology for mapping the decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and suggests ways to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP approach is proposed to learn a Hamming ball around codewords. An action-list decoding scheme is introduced using Deep-Q network values to improve decoder performance. The automorphism group of the code is utilized for further enhancements. A feedback-based method is presented to apply reinforcement learning after existing decoders to boost performance. These approaches simplify the complexity of reinforcement learning blocks. Experimental results for LDPC codes over the BSC show the effectiveness of these methods. <div>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions. Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy, addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality, task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates, critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system, implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question" vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts, https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the community.

This study focuses on inverse design of porous metamaterials using a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE) framework. The pVAE combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a regressor to generate porous structures with tailored hydraulic properties. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a bottom-up approach, the computational cost of predicting effective hydraulic properties is significantly reduced. The framework is trained on both synthetic and real datasets to capture key microstructural features and map them into a compact latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The analysis and interpretation of the latent space demonstrate its usefulness in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in the study will be made open-access to support further research. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically, we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder (VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space, demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made open-access to support further research.

Summary:<br />
This article discusses the importance of evaluating text-to-image models against adversarial attacks. Current methods for generating adversarial prompts are either human-authored or synthetic, presenting limitations in terms of size, diversity, and creativity. To address this, the authors propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method that combines human creativity with machine computational capacity to expand culturally diverse, human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting dataset maintains the characteristics and attack patterns of human prompts while achieving higher diversity and scalability. The expanded dataset demonstrates increased geographic locations and entropy compared to the original dataset. This work underscores the significance of human-machine collaboration in enhancing the robustness and safety evaluation of text-to-image models against novel adversarial attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28 entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Pretrained on large-scale urban graphs, the framework adapts in a cold-start scenario and fine-tunes with reinforcement learning. Evaluated on vast GPS data from three California metropolitan regions, UrbanPulse demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, it advances high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting to practical deployment in diverse cities.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning, transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Summary:<br />
1. The study introduces the MFTRR framework to enhance post-quality assessment by leveraging multimodal data and capturing fine-grained semantic interactions.<br />
2. MFTRR reframes the task as a ranking task, allowing for better capture of quality variations compared to traditional categorization methods.<br />
3. The framework includes the Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning Module, which models semantic interactions between posts and topics at multiple levels and suppresses noise.<br />
4. It also features the Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning.<br />
5. Experimental results show that MFTRR surpasses existing methods, achieving substantial improvements in NDCG@3 performance on various datasets. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2) introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals; and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework, which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3 improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

<div> LYRICS-TO-SONG GENERATION; VULNERABILITY; ADVERSARIAL ATTACK; MEMORIZATION; MULTIMODAL GENERATION<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models are susceptible to attacks that alter the semantics of lyrics while maintaining their acoustic structure, leading to sub-lexical memorization. The Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT) attack distorts lyrics phonetically, resulting in models like SUNO and YuE regenerating outputs similar to training data. This vulnerability extends across languages and genres, affecting both audio and visual modalities. Surprisingly, phoneme-altered lyrics can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models, leading to phonetic-to-visual regurgitation where models reconstruct elements from original music videos. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation, with implications for copyright, safety, and content authenticity in generative systems. <div>

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright, safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold. The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies. Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary (HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs" about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC. We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These results have important implications for our understanding and governance of LLMs.

Abstract: We present VIBE, a two-stage Transformer that fuses multi-modal video, audio, and text features to predict fMRI activity. Representations from open-source models (Qwen2.5, BEATs, Whisper, SlowFast, V-JEPA) are merged by a modality-fusion transformer and temporally decoded by a prediction transformer with rotary embeddings. Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod dataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six out-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Abstract: Despite being spoken by millions of people, Tigrinya remains severely underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. This work presents a comprehensive survey of NLP research for Tigrinya, analyzing over 40 studies spanning more than a decade of work from 2011 to 2025. We systematically review the current state of computational resources, models, and applications across ten distinct downstream tasks, including morphological processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and question-answering. Our analysis reveals a clear trajectory from foundational, rule-based systems to modern neural architectures, with progress consistently unlocked by resource creation milestones. We identify key challenges rooted in Tigrinya's morphological complexity and resource scarcity, while highlighting promising research directions, including morphology-aware modeling, cross-lingual transfer, and community-centered resource development. This work serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a roadmap for advancing Tigrinya NLP. A curated metadata of the surveyed studies and resources is made publicly available.\footnote{Tigrinya NLP Anthology: https://github.com/fgaim/tigrinya-nlp-anthology.

<title>Improving the Computational Efficiency and Explainability of GeoAggregator</title>

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness, achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and reproducibility.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios, and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability. The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9 percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable, transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational practice.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner (CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder. We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and generalization across vision-language domains.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However, system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets. Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to more quickly satisfy the user.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\&amp;E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&amp;E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly, leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and applicability.

<title>GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs</title>

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs. Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the speech domain.

arXiv:2507.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on \emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV} dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models (LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress, existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable, efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3 models.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the community.

<title>Distributional Uncertainty for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions; and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL) framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to synthesize healthy 3D brain tissue from masked input images, specifically focusing on the task of 'ASNR-MICCAI BraTS Local Synthesis of Tissue via Inpainting'. Our proposed method employs a U-Net-based architecture, which is designed to effectively reconstruct the missing or corrupted regions of brain MRI scans. To enhance our model's generalization capabilities and robustness, we implement a comprehensive data augmentation strategy that involves randomly masking healthy images during training. Our model is trained on the BraTS-Local-Inpainting dataset and demonstrates the exceptional performance in recovering healthy brain tissue. The evaluation metrics employed, including Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), consistently yields impressive results. On the BraTS-Local-Inpainting validation set, our model achieved an SSIM score of 0.841, a PSNR score of 23.257, and an MSE score of 0.007. Notably, these evaluation metrics exhibit relatively low standard deviations, i.e., 0.103 for SSIM score, 4.213 for PSNR score and 0.007 for MSE score, which indicates that our model's reliability and consistency across various input scenarios. Our method also secured first place in the challenge.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of 0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of 0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases. Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated, to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves the second place during the testing phase.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

<title>When Noisy Labels Meet Class Imbalance on Graphs: A Graph Augmentation Method with LLM and Pseudo Label</title>

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue, they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this paper systematically investigates robust node classification for class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

<title>Sticking to the Mean: Detecting Sticky Tokens in Text Embedding Models</title>

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings. These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future text embedding applications.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

<title>SCOPE: Stochastic and Counterbiased Option Placement for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used in any typical mobile robot application.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in information security, systematically review its application progress in malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and accurate information security protection system.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training. We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input, while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel, XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation, simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++). Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

<title>From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models</title>

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability, and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and educational analytics.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries, researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning. Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

<title>ReSem3D: Refinable 3D Spatial Constraints via Fine-Grained Semantic Grounding for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

<title>Locate-and-Focus: Enhancing Terminology Translation in Speech Language Models</title>

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays, yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and inconsistent imaging protocols, compounded by the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets for AI development. To address this gap, we present the first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719 high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with 20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.

<title>LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs, enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However, research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment requires scalability across various configurations and environments. Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations, legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage, vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects, enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical differences.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by 7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

<title>CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy</title>

arXiv:2507.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific, actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in low-resource NLP.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect: transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i) the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text, especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of data transfer.

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference, applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal. We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON. Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

<title>Reinforced Embodied Active Defense: Exploiting Adaptive Interaction for Robust Visual Perception in Adversarial 3D Environments</title>

arXiv:2507.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes. Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification, primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics, limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations. Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of individual features between different classes of models. With these two new tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs, where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance across extraction and classification tasks with substantial improvements in deployment accessibility compared to LLM-based alternatives. We release GLiNER2 as an open-source pip-installable library with pre-trained models and documentation at https://github.com/fastino-ai/GLiNER2.

<title>VideoMind: An Omni-Modal Video Dataset with Intent Grounding for Deep-Cognitive Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample. VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition. The data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab, https://github.com/cdx-cindy/VideoMind.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical framework for portfolio optimization, integrating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to combine sentiment signals from financial news with traditional market indicators. Our three-tier architecture employs base RL agents to process hybrid data, meta-agents to aggregate their decisions, and a super-agent to merge decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis. Evaluated on data from 2018 to 2024, after training on 2000-2017, the framework achieves a 26% annualized return and a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, outperforming equal-weighted and S&amp;P 500 benchmarks. Key contributions include scalable cross-modal integration, a hierarchical RL structure for enhanced stability, and open-source reproducibility.

<title>Beyond Internal Data: Constructing Complete Datasets for Fairness Testing</title>

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features. We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data, and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work, therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards inductive image-free inference.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences. However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design. Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool. Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona agents' perspectives.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models (FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related publications and resources will be maintained on our website https://github.com/FinFM/Awesome-FinFMs.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models, both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces \texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively. Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types, particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models' generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

<title>AQuilt: Weaving Logic and Self-Inspection into Low-Cost, High-Relevance Data Synthesis for Specialist LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover, customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source code, models, and scripts are available at https://github.com/Krueske/AQuilt.

<title>A Foundation Model for Massive MIMO Precoding with an Adaptive per-User Rate-Power Tradeoff</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning, solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches, like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.

<title>SynC: Synthetic Image Caption Dataset Refinement with One-to-many Mapping for Zero-shot Image Captioning</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC. Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain. We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios, particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Abstract: Effectively explaining decisions of black-box machine learning models is critical to responsible deployment of AI systems that rely on them. Recognizing their importance, the field of explainable AI (XAI) provides several techniques to generate these explanations. Yet, there is relatively little emphasis on the user (the explainee) in this growing body of work and most XAI techniques generate "one-size-fits-all" explanations. To bridge this gap and achieve a step closer towards human-centered XAI, we present I-CEE, a framework that provides Image Classification Explanations tailored to User Expertise. Informed by existing work, I-CEE explains the decisions of image classification models by providing the user with an informative subset of training data (i.e., example images), corresponding local explanations, and model decisions. However, unlike prior work, I-CEE models the informativeness of the example images to depend on user expertise, resulting in different examples for different users. We posit that by tailoring the example set to user expertise, I-CEE can better facilitate users' understanding and simulatability of the model. To evaluate our approach, we conduct detailed experiments in both simulation and with human participants (N = 100) on multiple datasets. Experiments with simulated users show that I-CEE improves users' ability to accurately predict the model's decisions (simulatability) compared to baselines, providing promising preliminary results. Experiments with human participants demonstrate that our method significantly improves user simulatability accuracy, highlighting the importance of human-centered XAI

Abstract: Provenance in databases has been thoroughly studied for positive and for recursive queries, then for first-order (FO) queries, i.e., having negation but no recursion. Query evaluation can be understood as a two-player game where the opponents argue whether or not a tuple is in the query answer. This game-theoretic approach yields a natural provenance model for FO queries, unifying how and why-not provenance. Here, we study the fine-grain structure of game provenance. A game $G=(V,E)$ consists of positions $V$ and moves $E$ and can be solved by computing the well-founded model of a single, unstratifiable rule: \[ \text{win}(X) \leftarrow \text{move}(X, Y), \neg \, \text{win}(Y). \] In the solved game $G^{\lambda}$, the value of a position $x\,{\in}\,V$ is either won, lost, or drawn. This value is explained by the provenance $\mathscr{P}$(x), i.e., certain (annotated) edges reachable from $x$. We identify seven edge types that give rise to new kinds of provenance, i.e., potential, actual, and primary, and demonstrate that "not all moves are created equal". We describe the new provenance types, show how they can be computed while solving games, and discuss applications, e.g., for abstract argumentation frameworks.

Abstract: Traditional causal discovery methods often rely on strong, untestable assumptions, which makes them unreliable in real applications. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for extracting causal knowledge from text-based metadata, which consolidates domain expertise. However, LLMs tend to be unreliable and prone to hallucinations, necessitating strategies that account for their limitations. One effective strategy is to use a consistency measure to assess reliability. Additionally, most text metadata does not clearly distinguish direct causal relationships from indirect ones, further complicating the discovery of a causal DAG. As a result, focusing on causal orders, rather than causal DAGs, emerges as a more practical and robust approach. We present a new method to derive a class of acyclic tournaments, which represent plausible causal orders, maximizing a consistency score derived from an LLM. Our approach starts by calculating pairwise consistency scores between variables, resulting in a semi-complete partially directed graph that consolidates these scores into an abstraction of the maximally consistent causal orders. Using this structure, we identify optimal acyclic tournaments, focusing on those that maximize consistency across all configurations. We subsequently show how both the abstraction and the class of causal orders can be used to estimate causal effects. We tested our method on both well-established benchmarks, as well as, real-world datasets from epidemiology and public health.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Model (LLM) responses with human preferences is vital for building safe and controllable AI systems. While preference optimization methods based on Plackett-Luce (PL) and Bradley-Terry (BT) models have shown promise, they face challenges such as poor handling of harmful content, inefficient use of dispreferred responses, and, specifically for PL, high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose Hard Preference Sampling (HPS), a novel framework for robust and efficient human preference alignment. HPS introduces a training loss that prioritizes the most preferred response while rejecting all dispreferred and harmful ones. It emphasizes "hard" dispreferred responses -- those closely resembling preferred ones -- to enhance the model's rejection capabilities. By leveraging a single-sample Monte Carlo sampling strategy, HPS reduces computational overhead while maintaining alignment quality. Theoretically, HPS improves sample efficiency over existing PL methods and maximizes the reward margin between preferred and dispreferred responses, ensuring clearer distinctions. Experiments on HH-RLHF and PKU-Safety datasets validate HPS's effectiveness, achieving comparable BLEU and reward scores while greatly improving reward margins and thus reducing harmful content generation.

Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "smallbut mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. We find that ChatGPT Agent significantly outperforms other computer-using agents with an overall accuracy of 65.8% (compared to e.g., Operator's 23.4%), showcasing substantial progress in tasks involving real computer use, such as playing web games and navigating 3D environments. Nevertheless, closing the gap to human performance requires improvements in areas like fine control, complex data filtering, and execution speed. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.

Abstract: While automated chemical tools excel at specific tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful tools enabling chemical analysis. When integrated with traditional search algorithms, they enable a new approach to computer-aided synthesis that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our system allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language -- from protecting group strategies to global feasibility assessment -- and uses traditional or LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to find routes that satisfy these constraints. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. This approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with newer and larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical automation systems.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), applying large language models (LLMs) to Operations Research (OR) problem-solving has attracted increasing attention. Most existing approaches attempt to improve OR problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The agent decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, a high-quality dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that existing benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR suffer from certain issues, making them less suitable for reliably evaluating LLM performance. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that OR-LLM-Agent outperforms advanced methods, including GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ORLM, by at least 7% in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task decomposition for OR problem solving.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.

Abstract: We introduce an open-ended test grounded in algorithmic probability that can avoid benchmark contamination in the quantitative evaluation of frontier models in the context of their Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence (ASI) claims. Unlike other tests, this test does not rely on statistical compression methods (such as GZIP or LZW), which are more closely related to Shannon entropy than to Kolmogorov complexity and are not able to test beyond simple pattern matching. The test challenges aspects of AI, in particular LLMs, related to features of intelligence of fundamental nature such as synthesis and model creation in the context of inverse problems (generating new knowledge from observation). We argue that metrics based on model abstraction and abduction (optimal Bayesian `inference') for predictive `planning' can provide a robust framework for testing intelligence, including natural intelligence (human and animal), narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. We found that LLM model versions tend to be fragile and incremental as a result of memorisation only with progress likely driven by the size of training data. The results were compared with a hybrid neurosymbolic approach that theoretically guarantees universal intelligence based on the principles of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The method outperforms LLMs in a proof-of-concept on short binary sequences. We prove that compression is equivalent and directly proportional to a system's predictive power and vice versa. That is, if a system can better predict it can better compress, and if it can better compress, then it can better predict. Our findings strengthen the suspicion regarding the fundamental limitations of LLMs, exposing them as systems optimised for the perception of mastery over human language.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and intervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise friendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of behaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more steerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems. We also show that human and AI intervention has different effects hence suggesting multiple strategies.

<title>Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Minimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to minimize the average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station (BS) stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), thus falling within the remit of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-Theta is employed to optimize the RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. The active beamforming at the BS is then derived from the jointly optimized RIS phase shifts and subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize the subcarrier allocation indicators more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture the network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, such as the number of backlogged packets in buffers and current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

<title>DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification</title>

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.

Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to correct outdated or inaccurate knowledge in neural networks. In this paper, we explore knowledge editing using easily accessible documents instead of manually labeled factual triples employed in earlier research. To advance this field, we establish the first evaluation benchmark, \textit{DocTER}, featuring Documents containing counterfactual knowledge for editing. A comprehensive four-perspective evaluation is introduced: Edit Success, Locality, Reasoning, and Cross-lingual Transfer. To adapt conventional triplet-based knowledge editing methods for this task, we develop an Extract-then-Edit pipeline that extracts triples from documents before applying existing methods. Experiments on popular knowledge editing methods demonstrate that editing with documents presents significantly greater challenges than using triples. In document-based scenarios, even the best-performing in-context editing approach still lags behind by 10 points in editing success when compared to using gold triples. This observation also holds for both reasoning and cross-lingual test sets. We further analyze key factors influencing task performance, including the quality of extracted triples, the frequency and position of edited knowledge in documents, various methods for enhancing reasoning, and performance differences across various directions in cross-lingual knowledge editing, which provide valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Do American presidents speak discernibly different from each other? If so, in what ways? And are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To investigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness based on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and presents a framework for assessing the distinctive ways in which presidents speak about their political opponents. Applying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find considerable evidence that Donald Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all major party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Trump is significantly more distinctive than his fellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values appear closer to those of the Democrats. Contributing to these differences is Trump's employment of divisive and antagonistic language, particularly when targeting his political opponents. These differences hold across a variety of measurement strategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential addresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular changes in presidential communications.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve remarkable performance, yet their decision-making processes often remain opaque. In response, the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has grown significantly over the last decade, primarily focusing on feature attribution methods. Complementing this perspective, Data Attribution (DA) has emerged as a promising paradigm that shifts the focus from features to data provenance. However, existing DA approaches suffer from prohibitively high computational costs and memory demands. Additionally, current attribution methods exhibit low sparsity, hindering the discovery of decisive patterns in the data. We introduce DualXDA, a framework for sparse, efficient and explainable DA, comprised of two interlinked approaches for Dual Data Attribution (DualDA) and eXplainable Data Attribution (XDA): With DualDA, we propose efficient and effective DA, leveraging Support Vector Machine theory to provide fast and naturally sparse data attributions for AI predictions. We demonstrate that DualDA achieves high attribution quality, excels at solving a series of evaluated downstream tasks, while at the same time improving explanation time by a factor of up to 4,100,000$\times$ compared to the original Influence Functions method, and up to 11,000$\times$ compared to the method's most efficient approximation from literature. We further introduce XDA, a method for enhancing Data Attribution with capabilities from feature attribution methods to explain why training samples are relevant for the prediction of a test sample in terms of impactful features. Taken together, our contributions in DualXDA ultimately point towards a future of eXplainable AI applied at unprecedented scale, enabling transparent, efficient and novel analysis of even the largest neural architectures fostering a new generation of accountable AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have opened up new avenues for producing synthetic data, particularly in the realm of structured tabular formats, such as product reviews. Despite the potential benefits, concerns regarding privacy leakage have surfaced, especially when personal information is utilized in the training datasets. In addition, there is an absence of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of quantitatively measuring the quality of the generated synthetic data and their utility for downstream tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce SynEval, an open-source evaluation framework designed to assess the fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation of synthetically generated tabular data via a suite of diverse evaluation metrics. We validate the efficacy of our proposed framework - SynEval - by applying it to synthetic product review data generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama. Our experimental findings illuminate the trade-offs between various evaluation metrics in the context of synthetic data generation. Furthermore, SynEval stands as a critical instrument for researchers and practitioners engaged with synthetic tabular data,, empowering them to judiciously determine the suitability of the generated data for their specific applications, with an emphasis on upholding user privacy.

Abstract: Concept drift is the phenomenon in which the underlying data distributions and statistical properties of a target domain change over time, leading to a degradation in model performance. Consequently, production models require continuous drift detection monitoring. Most drift detection methods to date are supervised, relying on ground-truth labels. However, they are inapplicable in many real-world scenarios, as true labels are often unavailable. Although recent efforts have proposed unsupervised drift detectors, many lack the accuracy required for reliable detection or are too computationally intensive for real-time use in high-dimensional, large-scale production environments. Moreover, they often fail to characterize or explain drift effectively.
  To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{DriftLens}, an unsupervised framework for real-time concept drift detection and characterization. Designed for deep learning classifiers handling unstructured data, \textsc{DriftLens} leverages distribution distances in deep learning representations to enable efficient and accurate detection. Additionally, it characterizes drift by analyzing and explaining its impact on each label. Our evaluation across classifiers and data-types demonstrates that \textsc{DriftLens} (i) outperforms previous methods in detecting drift in 15/17 use cases; (ii) runs at least 5 times faster; (iii) produces drift curves that align closely with actual drift (correlation $\geq\!0.85$); (iv) effectively identifies representative drift samples as explanations.

However, research on the domain generalizability of deep learning models for vision-language tasks remains limited, primarily because of the lack of required datasets. To address these challenges, we propose VolDoGer: Vision-Language Dataset for Domain Generalization, a dedicated dataset designed for domain generalization that addresses three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. We constructed VolDoGer by extending LLM-based data annotation techniques to vision-language tasks, thereby alleviating the burden of recruiting human annotators. We evaluated the domain generalizability of various models, ranging from fine-tuned models to a recent multimodal large language model, through VolDoGer.

Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning in neural information retrieval (IR), introducing a novel task termed Neural Machine UnRanking (NuMuR). This problem is motivated by growing demands for data privacy compliance and selective information removal in neural IR systems. Existing task- or model- agnostic unlearning approaches, primarily designed for classification tasks, are suboptimal for NuMuR due to two core challenges: (1) neural rankers output unnormalised relevance scores rather than probability distributions, limiting the effectiveness of traditional teacher-student distillation frameworks; and (2) entangled data scenarios, where queries and documents appear simultaneously across both forget and retain sets, may degrade retention performance in existing methods. To address these issues, we propose Contrastive and Consistent Loss (CoCoL), a dual-objective framework. CoCoL comprises (1) a contrastive loss that reduces relevance scores on forget sets while maintaining performance on entangled samples, and (2) a consistent loss that preserves accuracy on retain set. Extensive experiments on MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets, across four neural IR models, demonstrate that CoCoL achieves substantial forgetting with minimal retain and generalisation performance loss. Our method facilitates more effective and controllable data removal than existing techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents Rummaging Using Mutual Information (RUMI), a method for online generation of robot action sequences to gather information about the pose of a known movable object in visually-occluded environments. Focusing on contact-rich rummaging, our approach leverages mutual information between the object pose distribution and robot trajectory for action planning. From an observed partial point cloud, RUMI deduces the compatible object pose distribution and approximates the mutual information of it with workspace occupancy in real time. Based on this, we develop an information gain cost function and a reachability cost function to keep the object within the robot's reach. These are integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework with a stochastic dynamics model, updating the pose distribution in a closed loop. Key contributions include a new belief framework for object pose estimation, an efficient information gain computation strategy, and a robust MPC-based control scheme. RUMI demonstrates superior performance in both simulated and real tasks compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective for a variety of downstream tasks. However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.

Abstract: Real-time motion generation -- which is essential for achieving reactive and adaptive behavior -- under kinodynamic constraints for high-dimensional systems is a crucial yet challenging problem. We address this with a two-step approach: offline learning of a lower-dimensional trajectory manifold of task-relevant, constraint-satisfying trajectories, followed by rapid online search within this manifold. Extending the discrete-time Motion Manifold Primitives (MMP) framework, we propose Differentiable Motion Manifold Primitives (DMMP), a novel neural network architecture that encodes and generates continuous-time, differentiable trajectories, trained using data collected offline through trajectory optimizations, with a strategy that ensures constraint satisfaction -- absent in existing methods. Experiments on dynamic throwing with a 7-DoF robot arm demonstrate that DMMP outperforms prior methods in planning speed, task success, and constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in neural information retrieval (IR) systems requires removing specific data whilst maintaining model performance. Applying existing machine unlearning methods to IR may compromise retrieval effectiveness or inadvertently expose unlearning actions due to the removal of particular items from the retrieved results presented to users. We formalise corrective unranking, which extends machine unlearning in (neural) IR context by integrating substitute documents to preserve ranking integrity, and propose a novel teacher-student framework, Corrective unRanking Distillation (CuRD), for this task. CuRD (1) facilitates forgetting by adjusting the (trained) neural IR model such that its output relevance scores of to-be-forgotten samples mimic those of low-ranking, non-retrievable samples; (2) enables correction by fine-tuning the relevance scores for the substitute samples to match those of corresponding to-be-forgotten samples closely; (3) seeks to preserve performance on samples that are not targeted for forgetting. We evaluate CuRD on four neural IR models (BERTcat, BERTdot, ColBERT, PARADE) using MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets. Experiments with forget set sizes from 1 % and 20 % of the training dataset demonstrate that CuRD outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in terms of forgetting and correction while maintaining model retention and generalisation capabilities.

Abstract: To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.

<title>Integrating Evidence into the Design of XAI and AI-based Decision Support Systems: A Means-End Framework for End-users in Construction</title>

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence seeks to make the reasoning processes of AI models transparent and interpretable, particularly in complex decision making environments. In the construction industry, where AI based decision support systems are increasingly adopted, limited attention has been paid to the integration of supporting evidence that underpins the reliability and accountability of AI generated outputs. The absence of such evidence undermines the validity of explanations and the trustworthiness of system recommendations. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a theoretical, evidence based means end framework developed through a narrative review. The framework offers an epistemic foundation for designing XAI enabled DSS that generate meaningful explanations tailored to users knowledge needs and decision contexts. It focuses on evaluating the strength, relevance, and utility of different types of evidence supporting AI generated explanations. While developed with construction professionals as primary end users, the framework is also applicable to developers, regulators, and project managers with varying epistemic goals.

Abstract: We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.

Abstract: This paper studies an online variant of the celebrated housing market problem, where each agent has a single house and seeks to exchange it for another based on her preferences. In this online setting, agents may arrive and depart at any time, meaning that not all agents are present on the housing market simultaneously. I extend the well known serial dictatorship and Gale s top trading cycle mechanisms to this online scenario, aiming to retain their desirable properties such as Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy proofness. These extensions also seek to prevent agents from strategically delaying their arrival or advancing their departure. I demonstrate that achieving all of these properties simultaneously is impossible in the online context, and I present several variants that achieve different subsets of these properties.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based foundation models are gaining traction due to the widespread use of PPG in biosignal monitoring and their potential to generalize across diverse health applications. In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Existing encoder-free vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly narrowing the performance gap with their encoder-based counterparts, highlighting the promising potential for unified multimodal systems with structural simplicity and efficient deployment. We systematically clarify the performance gap between VLMs using pre-trained vision encoders, discrete tokenizers, and minimalist visual layers from scratch, deeply excavating the under-examined characteristics of encoder-free VLMs. We develop efficient strategies for encoder-free VLMs that rival mainstream encoder-based ones. After an in-depth investigation, we launch EVEv2.0, a new and improved family of encoder-free VLMs. We show that: (i) Properly decomposing and hierarchically associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities. (ii) A well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs. Through extensive evaluation, our EVEv2.0 represents a thorough study for developing a decoder-only architecture across modalities, demonstrating superior data efficiency and strong vision-reasoning capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring interpretive and inferential accuracy. In this paper, we introduce ExpliCa, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs in explicit causal reasoning. ExpliCa uniquely integrates both causal and temporal relations presented in different linguistic orders and explicitly expressed by linguistic connectives. The dataset is enriched with crowdsourced human acceptability ratings. We tested LLMs on ExpliCa through prompting and perplexity-based metrics. We assessed seven commercial and open-source LLMs, revealing that even top models struggle to reach 0.80 accuracy. Interestingly, models tend to confound temporal relations with causal ones, and their performance is also strongly influenced by the linguistic order of the events. Finally, perplexity-based scores and prompting performance are differently affected by model size.

Abstract: Accurate identification of bioactive peptides (BPs) and protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is essential for understanding protein function and advancing therapeutic discovery. However, most computational methods remain limited in their generalizability across diverse peptide functions. Here, we present PDeepPP, a unified deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture, enabling robust identification across diverse peptide classes and PTM sites. We curated comprehensive benchmark datasets and implemented strategies to address data imbalance, allowing PDeepPP to systematically extract both global and local sequence features. Through extensive analyses-including dimensionality reduction and comparison studies-PDeepPP demonstrates strong, interpretable peptide representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 25 of the 33 biological identification tasks. Notably, PDeepPP attains high accuracy in antimicrobial (0.9726) and phosphorylation site (0.9984) identification, with 99.5% specificity in glycosylation site prediction and substantial reduction in false negatives in antimalarial tasks. By enabling large-scale, accurate peptide analysis, PDeepPP supports biomedical research and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for disease treatment. All code, datasets, and pretrained models are publicly available via GitHub:https://github.com/fondress/PDeepPP and Hugging Face:https://huggingface.co/fondress/PDeppPP.

Abstract: The digitization of healthcare presents numerous challenges, including the complexity of biological systems, vast data generation, and the need for personalized treatment plans. Traditional computational methods often fall short, leading to delayed and sometimes ineffective diagnoses and treatments. Quantum Computing (QC) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offer transformative advancements with the potential to revolutionize medicine. This paper summarizes areas where QC promises unprecedented computational power, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatments, and enhanced drug discovery processes. However, integrating quantum technologies into precision medicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high costs. We show that mathematically-based techniques for specifying, developing, and verifying software (formal methods) can enhance the reliability and correctness of QC. By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal methods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In genomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define the behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic markers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically explore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly under all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3) proof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Additionally, formal optimization techniques can (4) enhance the efficiency and performance of quantum algorithms by reducing resource usage, such as the number of qubits and gate operations. Therefore, we posit that formal methods can significantly contribute to enabling QC to realize its full potential as a game changer in precision medicine.

Abstract: Hallucinations are spurious structures not present in the ground truth, posing a critical challenge in medical image reconstruction, especially for data-driven conditional models. We hypothesize that combining an unconditional diffusion model with data consistency, trained on a diverse dataset, can reduce these hallucinations. Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based framework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to enhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing hallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a conditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse problem solver. DynamicDPS skips early stage in the reverse process by selecting an optimal starting time point per sample and applies Wolfe's line search for adaptive step sizes, improving both efficiency and image fidelity. Using diffusion priors and data consistency, our method effectively reduces hallucinations from any conditional model output. We validate its effectiveness in Image Quality Transfer for low-field MRI enhancement. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real MR scans, including a downstream task for tissue volume estimation, show that DynamicDPS reduces hallucinations, improving relative volume estimation by over 15% for critical tissues while using only 5% of the sampling steps required by baseline diffusion models. As a model-agnostic and fine-tuning-free approach, DynamicDPS offers a robust solution for hallucination reduction in medical imaging. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

<title>Robust Multi-View Learning via Representation Fusion of Sample-Level Attention and Alignment of Simulated Perturbation</title>

arXiv:2503.04151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multi-view learning (MVL) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to fuse discriminative information from multiple views. However, real-world multi-view datasets are often heterogeneous and imperfect, which usually causes MVL methods designed for specific combinations of views to lack application potential and limits their effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust MVL method (namely RML) with simultaneous representation fusion and alignment. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-view transformer fusion network where we transform heterogeneous multi-view data into homogeneous word embeddings, and then integrate multiple views by the sample-level attention mechanism to obtain a fused representation. Furthermore, we propose a simulated perturbation based multi-view contrastive learning framework that dynamically generates the noise and unusable perturbations for simulating imperfect data conditions. The simulated noisy and unusable data obtain two distinct fused representations, and we utilize contrastive learning to align them for learning discriminative and robust representations. Our RML is self-supervised and can also be applied for downstream tasks as a regularization. In experiments, we employ it in multi-view unsupervised clustering, noise-label classification, and as a plug-and-play module for cross-modal hashing retrieval. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies validate RML's effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/SubmissionsIn/RML.

<title>When Large Vision-Language Model Meets Large Remote Sensing Imagery: Coarse-to-Fine Text-Guided Token Pruning</title>

Abstract: Efficient vision-language understanding of large Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) is meaningful but challenging. Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically employ limited pre-defined grids to process images, leading to information loss when handling gigapixel RSIs. Conversely, using unlimited grids significantly increases computational costs. To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration. Our method introduces: (i) a Region Focus Module (RFM) that leverages text-aware region localization capability to identify critical vision tokens, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine image tile selection and vision token pruning strategy based on DIP, which is guided by RFM outputs and avoids directly processing the entire large imagery. Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels. Our method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies on four datasets using the same data. Moreover, compared to existing token reduction methods, our approach demonstrates higher efficiency under high-resolution settings. Dataset and code are in https://github.com/VisionXLab/LRS-VQA.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models. Our code is published at https://github.com/Wings-Of-Disaster/VaLiK.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

<title>Trigger without Trace: Towards Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks targeting text-to-image diffusion models have advanced rapidly. However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to identify. In this paper, toward stealthy backdoor samples, we propose Trigger without Trace (TwT) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically, our approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the sensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic consistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention responses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 97.5% attack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses. It achieves an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three state-of-the-art detection mechanisms, revealing the vulnerabilities of current backdoor defense methods.

<title>LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are Important</title>

Abstract: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modification of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Based on the fact that the Large Language models are autoregressive models, we propose LagKV, a KV compression strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themselves. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on RULER benchmark show that, our approach outperforms SnapKV and StreamingLLM in different compression ratios. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our method outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $50\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes, code & models. https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models

Abstract: Detecting plant diseases is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture, as it plays a key role in maintaining crop health and increasing overall yield. Traditional approaches, though still valuable, often rely on manual inspection or conventional machine learning techniques, both of which face limitations in scalability and accuracy. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as improved handling of long-range dependencies and better scalability for visual tasks. This review explores the application of ViTs in precision agriculture, covering a range of tasks. We begin by introducing the foundational architecture of ViTs and discussing their transition from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Computer Vision. The discussion includes the concept of inductive bias in traditional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and how ViTs mitigate these biases. We provide a comprehensive review of recent literature, focusing on key methodologies, datasets, and performance metrics. This study also includes a comparative analysis of CNNs and ViTs, along with a review of hybrid models and performance enhancements. Technical challenges such as data requirements, computational demands, and model interpretability are addressed, along with potential solutions. Finally, we outline future research directions and technological advancements that could further support the integration of ViTs in real-world agricultural settings. Our goal with this study is to offer practitioners and researchers a deeper understanding of how ViTs are poised to transform smart and precision agriculture.

Abstract: On-device learning has emerged as a promising direction for AI development, particularly because of its potential to reduce latency issues and mitigate privacy risks associated with device-server communication, while improving energy efficiency. Despite these advantages, significant memory and computational constraints still represent major challenges for its deployment. Drawing on previous studies on low-rank decomposition methods that address activation memory bottlenecks in backpropagation, we propose a novel shortcut approach as an alternative. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce activation memory usage, even up to $120.09\times$ compared to vanilla training, while also reducing overall training FLOPs up to $1.86\times$ when evaluated on traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%), ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However, it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic features.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with outcome-based feedback faces a fundamental challenge: when rewards are only observed at trajectory endpoints, how do we assign credit to the right actions? This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this problem in online RL with general function approximation. We develop a provably sample-efficient algorithm achieving $\widetilde{O}({C_{\rm cov} H^3}/{\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity, where $C_{\rm cov}$ is the coverability coefficient of the underlying MDP. By leveraging general function approximation, our approach works effectively in large or infinite state spaces where tabular methods fail, requiring only that value functions and reward functions can be represented by appropriate function classes. Our results also characterize when outcome-based feedback is statistically separated from per-step rewards, revealing an unavoidable exponential separation for certain MDPs. For deterministic MDPs, we show how to eliminate the completeness assumption, dramatically simplifying the algorithm. We further extend our approach to preference-based feedback settings, proving that equivalent statistical efficiency can be achieved even under more limited information. Together, these results constitute a theoretical foundation for understanding the statistical properties of outcome-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses, especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved 100% attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than cent percent accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.

<title>LLM-D12: A Dual-Dimensional Scale of Instrumental and Relational Dependencies on Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.06874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.

<title>Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics (LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover, unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2 demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.0% and 70.7% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-R1 across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1 shows steady performance improvements as the number of input video frames increases. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these models rely solely on superficial statistics. We offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms "features" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" connecting these facts. However, these forms of understanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the phenomenon of "parallel mechanisms" shows. We conclude that the debate should move beyond the yes-or-no question of whether LLMs understand to investigate how their strange minds work and forge conceptions that fit them.

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach, OrQstrator, which is a modular framework for conducting quantum circuit optimization in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints.

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

<title>EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405 multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.

Abstract: Food is not only essential to human health but also serves as a medium for cultural identity and emotional connection. In the context of precision nutrition, accurately identifying and classifying food images is critical for dietary monitoring, nutrient estimation, and personalized health management. However, fine-grained food classification remains challenging due to the subtle visual differences among similar dishes. To address this, we propose Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet), a novel deep learning model designed to improve the accuracy of food image recognition in fine-grained scenarios. Built on the TResNet architecture, FE-TResNet integrates a Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) to enhance feature extraction and emphasize subtle distinctions between food items. Evaluated on two benchmark Chinese food datasets-ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241-FE-TResNet achieved high classification accuracies of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively. These results demonstrate its effectiveness and highlight its potential as a key enabler for intelligent dietary assessment and personalized recommendations in precision nutrition systems.

Abstract: Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However, the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts (EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry, this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.

<title>New Mechanisms in Flex Distribution for Bounded Suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

<div> Keywords: Multi-Agent Path Finding, Conflict-Based Search, Estimation, Flex Distribution, Delay-Based

Summary: 
Conflict-Based Flex Distribution is proposed to optimize Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) for the Multi-Agent Path Finding problem. The approach redistributes flex based on the number of collisions, improving efficiency by focusing on resolving collisions on specific sets of paths. Additionally, Delay-Based Flex Distribution estimates constraint delays, enhancing path optimization. A Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution combines both mechanisms in a hierarchical framework for further improvements. The new flex distribution methods ensure completeness and bounded-suboptimal solutions for EECBS. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches over the original greedy flex distribution strategy. Overall, the proposed techniques significantly enhance the performance of EECBS in solving MAPF problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location. Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of paths whose SOC is at most $w \cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution, increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \cdot LB$, forcing EECBS to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, fine-tuning, safety alignment, LoRA, reasoning abilities

Summary: 
In this work, the authors address the challenge of maintaining the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) while fine-tuning them for specific tasks post-training. They introduce LoRA, a method for safety alignment fine-tuning (SFT), which effectively aligns the model for safety without compromising its reasoning abilities. By restricting safety weight updates to a low-rank space, LoRA minimizes interference with reasoning weights, resulting in highly safe LLMs across various benchmarks. The study shows that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. Additionally, the authors explore techniques such as regularization and weight merging to further reduce overlap and observe improvements on specific tasks. Overall, the findings suggest that LoRA is a promising approach for achieving a consistent balance between reasoning abilities and safety in LLMs, encouraging the development of more effective strategies in the reasoning-safety trade-off. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.

The article introduces the use of Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While domain-specific continued pretraining methods have shown promise, they lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. The authors pioneer the use of GPR tasks, such as pathfinding and network analysis, to teach diverse reasoning patterns. They introduce GraphPile, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for Continued Pretraining using GPR data, containing 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks. Training GraphMind on popular base models achieves higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and improves non-mathematical reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. This work bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability and robustness of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks, yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems. Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks, spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and 3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability and robustness of LLMs.

<div> Keywords: agentic capability, trustworthiness, language model agents, agent identity evals, LMA system

Summary:
Central to the effectiveness of language model agents (LMAs) is their ability to maintain a stable and reliable identity over time. However, LMAs face challenges such as statelessness, stochasticity, and sensitivity to prompts which can impact their identity, reliability, and trustworthiness. In order to address these challenges, the concept of agent identity evals (AIE) is introduced as a framework to measure the consistency and persistence of LMAs over time. AIE includes novel metrics that can be used to assess the agentic identity of LMAs and improve their performance. By incorporating AIE into the design and evaluation of LMAs, researchers can enhance their capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and action. This framework provides a systematic approach to evaluating and improving LMAs throughout their life cycle, ensuring their continued reliability and utility. <div>

Abstract: Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents (LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time. However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs) (statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability, continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous, statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations. AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

Abstract: Building on prior research on Generative AI (GenAI) and related tools for programming education, we developed SCRIPT, a chatbot based on ChatGPT-4o-mini, to support novice learners. SCRIPT allows for open-ended interactions and structured guidance through predefined prompts. We evaluated the tool via an experiment with 136 students from an introductory programming course at a large German university and analyzed how students interacted with SCRIPT while solving programming tasks with a focus on their feedback preferences. The results reveal that students' feedback requests seem to follow a specific sequence. Moreover, the chatbot responses aligned well with students' requested feedback types (in 75%), and it adhered to the system prompt constraints. These insights inform the design of GenAI-based learning support systems and highlight challenges in balancing guidance and flexibility in AI-assisted tools.

<div> Keywords: Compliance Brain Assistant, AI assistant, user query router, FastTrack mode, FullAgentic mode

Summary:
Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA) is an AI assistant designed to enhance efficiency in compliance tasks within enterprise environments. It employs a user query router to intelligently choose between FastTrack mode for simple requests and FullAgentic mode for complex tasks that require composite actions. By proactively discovering context across compliance artifacts and utilizing various APIs, CBA provides curated responses. Experimental evaluations comparing CBA to a standard LLM demonstrated significant performance improvements in keyword match rate and pass rate. The routing-based design found a balance between the two modes, resulting in better overall performance metrics without sacrificing runtime efficiency. The study validates the effectiveness of the routing mechanism in enhancing the AI assistant's capabilities for handling compliance-related queries.

Abstract: This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational, agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and (ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.
  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

Summary: 
Ctx2TrajGen is a novel framework for generating realistic urban driving behaviors by leveraging Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). This framework considers nonlinear interdependencies and training instability present in microscopic vehicle trajectory modeling. By taking into account surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen produces interaction-aware trajectories that align with real-world contexts. Experimental results on the DRIFT dataset, captured by drones, show that Ctx2TrajGen outperforms existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity, and contextual fidelity. This framework offers a robust solution to the challenges of data scarcity and domain shift in generating accurate microscopic vehicle trajectories without relying on simulation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Precise modeling of microscopic vehicle trajectories is critical for traffic behavior analysis and autonomous driving systems. We propose Ctx2TrajGen, a context-aware trajectory generation framework that synthesizes realistic urban driving behaviors using GAIL.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in instruction following and reasoning. However, ensuring alignment with human intent and safety norms remains a challenge. The Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework aims to enhance LLM alignment without human annotations. UDASA generates multiple responses for each input and measures output uncertainty in semantics, factuality, and value alignment. By categorizing training samples based on uncertainty scores, UDASA optimizes model performance progressively. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of UDASA in harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation tasks compared to existing methods. The framework's automated approach shows promise in improving LLM alignment efficiently and effectively. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in instruction following and general-purpose reasoning. However, achieving high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory, according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation, significantly improving model performance.

Summary: 
This study introduces LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that generates datasets for evaluating neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods in temporal and constraint-driven scenarios. The framework generates tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints and image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations enable testing of various training settings on the same datasets. Experiments on neuro-symbolic sequence classification and class-continual learning tasks reveal the challenges of temporal learning and reasoning and identify limitations in current methods. The LTLZinc generator and ten tasks are released to the research community to advance research on unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks. <div>
arXiv:2507.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.

<div> Keywords: Controlled Query Evaluation, Epistemic Dependencies, Ontologies, GA Censors, BUCQs

Summary:
Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies is studied with regulation based on epistemic dependencies (EDs) and optimal GA censors. The combination of these elements aims to ensure secure information disclosure. By focusing on answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs) using the intersection of optimal GA censors, a strong security guarantee with efficient computational behavior is achieved. The security of this approach is characterized, specifically for full EDs. For a subclass of EDs and DL-Lite_R ontologies, it is demonstrated that answering BUCQs in this CQE framework is in AC^0 in data complexity, supported by a detailed first-order rewriting algorithm. Experimental evaluations illustrate the practical feasibility of the proposed rewriting function in two different scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We investigate Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies, where information disclosure is regulated by epistemic dependencies (EDs), a family of logical rules recently proposed for the CQE framework. In particular, we combine EDs with the notion of optimal GA censors, i.e. maximal sets of ground atoms that are entailed by the ontology and can be safely revealed. We focus on answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs) with respect to the intersection of all optimal GA censors - an approach that has been shown in other contexts to ensure strong security guarantees with favorable computational behavior. First, we characterize the security of this intersection-based approach and identify a class of EDs (namely, full EDs) for which it remains safe. Then, for a subclass of EDs and for DL-Lite_R ontologies, we show that answering BUCQs in the above CQE semantics is in AC^0 in data complexity by presenting a suitable, detailed first-order rewriting algorithm. Finally, we report on experiments conducted in two different evaluation scenarios, showing the practical feasibility of our rewriting function.

Abstract: The grounding bottleneck poses one of the key challenges that hinders the widespread adoption of Answer Set Programming in industry. Hybrid Grounding is a step in alleviating the bottleneck by combining the strength of standard bottom-up grounding with recently proposed techniques where rule bodies are decoupled during grounding. However, it has remained unclear when hybrid grounding shall use body-decoupled grounding and when to use standard bottom-up grounding. In this paper, we address this issue by developing automated hybrid grounding: we introduce a splitting algorithm based on data-structural heuristics that detects when to use body-decoupled grounding and when standard grounding is beneficial. We base our heuristics on the structure of rules and an estimation procedure that incorporates the data of the instance. The experiments conducted on our prototypical implementation demonstrate promising results, which show an improvement on hard-to-ground scenarios, whereas on hard-to-solve instances we approach state-of-the-art performance.

arXiv:2507.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.

Summary:  
FundusExpert is introduced as an ophthalmology-specific Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities. FundusGen, a dataset generated through the Fundus-Engine system, provides annotation granularity and reasoning logic alignment for the model. The Fundus-Engine automates localization and integrates global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within fundus images. Fine-tuned with FundusGen data, FundusExpert outperforms existing models in ophthalmic question-answering and zero-shot report generation tasks. A scaling law between data quality and model capability is demonstrated, showing improved efficiency with cognitive alignment annotations. By incorporating region-level localization and diagnostic reasoning chains, this work aims to bridge the visual-language gap in specialized MLLMs. The project can be accessed at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen, achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$), demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study introduces the HoPeS modelling framework, utilizing agents powered by large language models to represent various stakeholder perspectives in socio-ecological systems. Users can engage in perspective-taking simulations to gain insights into different viewpoints. A simulation protocol guides users through transitioning between roles and reflecting on diverse perspectives. The prototype system focuses on institutional dynamics and land use change, allowing users to explore narrative-driven and numerical experiments. An illustrative experiment showcases the challenges of aligning policy recommendations with stakeholder interests, highlighting the complexities of interdisciplinary collaboration. The user's experience as a researcher emphasizes the struggle to balance technical expertise with political influence, revealing the nuances of decision-making processes. Despite obstacles, the system shows promise in facilitating alternative narrative framing strategies and promoting deeper understanding of socio-ecological dynamics. Refinements to the system and protocol can enhance its use in exploring diverse stakeholder perspectives. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting) modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a "scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher - a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g., [Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools, Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.

Abstract: Research communities have developed benchmark datasets across domains to compare the performance of algorithms and techniques However, tracking the progress in these research areas is not easy, as publications appear in different venues at the same time, and many of them claim to represent the state-of-the-art. To address this, research communities often organise periodic competitions to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and techniques, thereby tracking advancements in the field. However, these competitions pose a significant operational burden. The organisers must manage and evaluate a large volume of submissions.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models (S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4) robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Summary:<br />
ExplainVulD is a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. It addresses the challenge of class imbalance in datasets by using dual-channel embeddings and an edge-aware attention mechanism. The model achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent on the ReVeal dataset, outperforming previous learning-based methods and static analysis tools. ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying influential code regions within functions, promoting transparency and trust in security triage. <div>

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging, particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability, limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information. These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss. ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic analysis of the disaster informatics literature published between January 2020 to September 2022. Leveraging a large-scale corpus and advanced techniques such as pre-trained language models and generative AI, we identify the most active countries, institutions, authors, collaboration networks, emergent topics, patterns among the most significant topics, and shifts in research priorities spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight (1) countries that were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active, with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics, and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the trends in disaster informatics, our analysis offers strategic insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF, a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations, multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query. Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query. Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\%, surpassing the BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\% to 64.98\%). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF approach.

Summary:
The paper introduces a model-agnostic method leveraging conformal risk control to limit unwanted content in personalized recommendations. It addresses issues of irrelevant and harmful recommendations on online platforms, aiming to improve user satisfaction and combat societal problems like misinformation and radicalization. The approach uses simple binary feedback on items to control the risk of undesirable recommendations effectively. Additionally, it overcomes a limitation of traditional methods by incorporating implicit feedback on consumed items to expand recommendation sets while maintaining robust risk mitigation. Experimental results on data from a popular online video-sharing platform demonstrate the effectiveness and ease of implementation of this approach, showcasing a significant reduction in unwanted recommendations. The source code for the method is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Recommenders are significantly shaping online information consumption. While effective at personalizing content, these systems increasingly face criticism for propagating irrelevant, unwanted, and even harmful recommendations. Such content degrades user satisfaction and contributes to significant societal issues, including misinformation, radicalization, and erosion of user trust. Although platforms offer mechanisms to mitigate exposure to undesired content, these mechanisms are often insufficiently effective and slow to adapt to users' feedback. This paper introduces an intuitive, model-agnostic, and distribution-free method that uses conformal risk control to provably bound unwanted content in personalized recommendations by leveraging simple binary feedback on items. We also address a limitation of traditional conformal risk control approaches, i.e., the fact that the recommender can provide a smaller set of recommended items, by leveraging implicit feedback on consumed items to expand the recommendation set while ensuring robust risk mitigation. Our experimental evaluation on data coming from a popular online video-sharing platform demonstrates that our approach ensures an effective and controllable reduction of unwanted recommendations with minimal effort.

<div> Alignment-free GOP, CTC-trained ASR models, phoneme-level pronunciation assessment, mispronunciation detection, computer aided language learning 

Summary:
The study focuses on mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) in computer aided language learning systems. Current systems use goodness of pronunciation (GOP) based on segmented speech, limiting accuracy and the use of modern CTC-trained ASR models. The researchers propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) and alignment-free GOP (GOP-AF) to address these limitations. GOP-AF considers all possible alignments of the target phoneme, with a theoretical account, implementation, and normalization for different acoustic models. Experimental results on CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly with the peakiness of acoustic models and context around the target phoneme. Comparison with previous studies on Speechocean762 data demonstrates state-of-the-art results in phoneme-level pronunciation assessment using the proposed feature vectors. <div>

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in modern computer aided language learning (CALL) systems. Within MDD, phoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve their pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of pronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with recent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

Summary: 
CASPER, a novel contrastive learning framework, is proposed for enhancing the detection of smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that require large amounts of labeled data for model training, CASPER uses contrastive learning techniques to learn effective representations of smart contract source code using unlabeled datasets. In experiments with the XBlock dataset, CASPER outperformed the baseline model by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. Remarkably, even with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieved an F1 score nearly 20% higher than the baseline. These results demonstrate the potential of CASPER for cost-efficient and scalable fraud detection in digital currency trading, helping to address the emergence of smart Ponzi schemes in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital currency trading, fueled by the integration of blockchain technology, has led to both innovation and the emergence of smart Ponzi schemes. A smart Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation in smart contract that uses funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning typically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of labeled data. However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more negative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in blockchain transactions. By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER can learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using unlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system complexity. We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the baseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. More impressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly 20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions. These results highlight CASPER's potential for effective and cost-efficient detection of smart Ponzi schemes, paving the way for scalable fraud detection solutions in the future.

This framework incorporates both malicious and legitimate bots with controlled dynamic participation, allowing for quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. MADD is evaluated using individual and group level metrics, demonstrating its real-world consistency in user attributes and network structure. By simulating the dissemination of six disinformation topics, the study highlights the differential effects of fact-based and narrative-based correction strategies. MADD provides insights into understanding the role of social bots and offers a basis for risk control and improved governance in combating disinformation.

Abstract: In the human-bot symbiotic information ecosystem, social bots play key roles in spreading and correcting disinformation. Understanding their influence is essential for risk control and better governance. However, current studies often rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook the dynamic behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. To fill these gaps, we propose MADD, a Multi Agent based framework for Disinformation Dissemination. MADD constructs a more realistic propagation network by integrating the Barabasi Albert Model for scale free topology and the Stochastic Block Model for community structures, while designing node attributes based on real world user data. Furthermore, MADD incorporates both malicious and legitimate bots, with their controlled dynamic participation allows for quantitative analysis of correction strategies. We evaluate MADD using individual and group level metrics. We experimentally verify the real world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure, and we simulate the dissemination of six disinformation topics, demonstrating the differential effects of fact based and narrative based correction strategies.

Summary:
The study introduces a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework for refining disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery to support the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the Taiwan Space Agency (TASA).

Evaluation against higher-resolution EVAP output shows improved spatial coherence and segmentation consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes wildfire demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in producing more reliable and smooth segmentation results, offering a scalable solution for disaster mapping in the absence of accurate ground truth data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Summary: 
This article presents a framework for real-time 3D human pose estimation from monocular images, utilizing a combination of 2D keypoint detection and geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting. The approach incorporates known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors to improve accuracy. By generating training pairs from motion capture and synthetic datasets, the framework enables personalized, fast, and accurate 3D pose estimation without the need for specialized hardware. The method leverages self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to enhance the generation of plausible 2D-3D data. The proposed approach aims to bridge data-driven learning with model-based priors to enhance the interpretability, accuracy, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in real-world settings.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments. While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

Summary:
SynthCTI is a data augmentation framework designed to address the challenges of mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining. It utilizes a clustering-based strategy to generate high-quality synthetic CTI sentences for underrepresented techniques. By guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in producing lexically diverse and semantically faithful synthetic data, SynthCTI enhances model performance on two publicly available CTI datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM. Results show consistent macro-F1 improvements, with models such as ALBERT and SecureBERT significantly boosting their performance when augmented with synthetic data. Notably, smaller models augmented with SynthCTI outperform larger models trained without augmentation, highlighting the importance of data generation methods in building efficient and effective CTI classification systems. <div>

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining involves extracting structured insights from unstructured threat data, enabling organizations to understand and respond to evolving adversarial behavior. A key task in CTI mining is mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\&amp;CK techniques. However, this process is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and substantial effort. Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture rather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI, a data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI sentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\&amp;CK techniques. Our method uses a clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and guide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse and semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity. Incorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for example, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\%), and SecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412). Notably, smaller models augmented with SynthCTI outperform larger models trained without augmentation, demonstrating the value of data generation methods for building efficient and effective CTI classification systems.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis, Contrastive Learning, Progressive Attention Fusion, Adaptive Multi-loss, Fine-grained representations

Summary: 
The paper introduces a framework called CLAMP for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA). CLAMP addresses challenges like cross-modal alignment noise and inconsistent fine-grained representations. The framework consists of three modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive Attention Fusion network enhances alignment between textual features and image regions by hierarchical cross-modal interactions, reducing irrelevant visual noise. Multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local granularity alignment for better cross-modal representation consistency. Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation uses a dynamic uncertainty-based weighting mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to task uncertainty, minimizing gradient interference. Experimental results show that CLAMP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring. Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly, multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency. Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty, thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority of existing state of the art methods.

<div> captioning, intent inference, response refinement, safety improvements, intent-aware reasoning 
Summary: 
SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness) is a training-free framework designed to detect and mitigate harmful intent in vision-language models. It operates through a three-stage reasoning process: visual abstraction via captioning, intent inference using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and intent-conditioned response refinement. SIA dynamically adapts to implicit intent inferred from image-text pairs, rather than relying on predefined rules or classifiers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe show that SIA significantly enhances safety, outperforming previous methods. While SIA may result in a slight decrease in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the safety enhancements underscore the importance of intent-aware reasoning in aligning vision-language models with human values. <div>
arXiv:2507.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the challenge of fatigue detection in real-world settings, where high-end sensors are not always practical. The proposed framework leverages knowledge from diverse sources with varying sensor configurations to detect fatigue. By adaptively utilizing available modalities and incorporating data from different environments, the framework demonstrates practicality, robustness, and improved generalization in fatigue monitoring. The experiments conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and public datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach, paving the way for efficient fatigue monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such as aviation, mining, and long-haul transport. However, most existing methods rely on high-end sensors and controlled environments, limiting their applicability in real world settings. This paper formally defines a practical yet underexplored problem setting for real world fatigue detection, where systems operating with context-appropriate sensors aim to leverage knowledge from differently instrumented sources including those using impractical sensors deployed in controlled environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous and multi-source fatigue detection framework that adaptively utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while benefiting from the diverse configurations present in source domains. Our experiments, conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and two publicly available datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved generalization of our approach, paving the practical way for effective fatigue monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios.

Summary:
The article addresses the misalignment issues between LiDAR and camera inputs in Bird's-Eye-View representations for autonomous vehicles. It introduces Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC) to correct local misalignments using 2D object priors, and Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to handle global misalignments by enhancing object-background boundaries. The Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM) effectively fuses aligned depth and image features using a gated attention mechanism.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors. Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenge of achieving human-like perception in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While previous research has focused on improving reasoning abilities, this paper introduces the Turing Eye Test (TET), a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' performance on perceptual tasks based on synthetic images. The findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle with tasks that are easy for humans, indicating a gap in visual generalization. In contrast to previous benchmarks, in-context learning and training on the language backbone do not improve performance on TET tasks. Fine-tuning the vision tower, however, leads to rapid adaptation, highlighting the importance of visual processing in MLLMs. The study releases a subset of TET tasks and plans to introduce more challenging tasks to enhance visual generalization in future work. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning, we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods to enhance visual generalization in future work.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term rewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state representations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by (32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control benchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by (16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control benchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in reinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that involve hierarchical structures.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware reinforcement learning algorithm for intelligent operation of multi-microgrid systems. With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.

<div> privacy risk, model compression, deep learning, membership inference attack, CompLeak

Summary: 
Model compression is essential for optimizing memory storage and speeding up inference in deep learning models, but the privacy risks associated with compression techniques are often overlooked. This study introduces CompLeak, a novel framework that evaluates privacy risks in three commonly used compression configurations - pruning, quantization, and weight clustering. Through the lens of membership inference attacks, CompLeak examines the impact of different compressed models on privacy leakage. Three variants of CompLeak are proposed, each focusing on different scenarios based on the availability of compressed models and the original model. By conducting experiments on various model architectures and datasets, the study highlights the significance of considering privacy risks in model compression strategies to protect sensitive information. <div>
arXiv:2507.16872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model compression is crucial for minimizing memory storage and accelerating inference in deep learning (DL) models, including recent foundation models like large language models (LLMs). Users can access different compressed model versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood.
  In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model, CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark datasets.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the Real-Time Multi-Agent Pathfinding (RT-MAPF) problem, where agents must move without waiting for all paths to be generated. Existing solutions iteratively use windowed versions of MAPF algorithms without considering planning budget size. The study explores different budget allocation policies for windowed MAPF algorithms like Prioritized Planning and MAPF-LNS2. It finds that sharing a planning budget pool is ineffective in highly constrained scenarios. Instead, distributing the budget among agents allows for more problems to be solved with shorter completion times. This research fills a gap in RT-MAPF solutions by optimizing planning budget allocation strategies to improve performance in real-time multi-agent pathfinding scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for a set of agents such that each agent reaches its desired destination while avoiding collisions with the other agents. Many MAPF solvers are designed to run offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them. Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time, referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning integrating histopathology and molecular data shows promise for cancer prognostication. We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745).
  Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility.
  Multimodal WSI-omics survival prediction is a fast-growing field with promising results but needs improved methodological rigor, broader datasets, and clinical evaluation.

ReMeX dataset is constructed for relation-aware, multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). ReMeREC framework is proposed to localize multiple entities and model their inter-relations by leveraging visual and textual cues. The Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) dynamically infers entity quantity and span from textual cues.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained, paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally, our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset, EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing approaches by a large margin.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image diffusion models, data privacy, memorization, replication, adversarial fine-tuning <br />
Summary: 
This research evaluates the vulnerabilities of text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) regarding data privacy and intellectual property concerns. Current pruning-based mitigation efforts to prevent model memorization are found to be ineffective, as minor changes in input prompts can still trigger data replication. The assumption that memorization is localized is challenged, as replication can be initiated from various points in the text embedding space. The study introduces an adversarial fine-tuning method to increase model robustness by iteratively searching for replication triggers. These findings highlight the need for improved strategies to eliminate memorized content rather than simply suppressing its retrieval, emphasizing the importance of building trustworthy and compliant generative AI systems. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

<br />
Probabilistic encoding with Gaussian noise in neural networks enhances generalization ability but distorts distance measurements in classification tasks. To address this issue, the confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE) method is introduced. It refines probabilistic encoding by incorporating a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations and replaces KL divergence-based variance regularization with an L2 regularization term for improved variance control. The CPE method is applicable to any model and experimental results on natural language classification tasks show significant performance improvements on BERT and RoBERTa models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Probabilistic encoding introduces Gaussian noise into neural networks, enabling a smooth transition from deterministic to uncertain states and enhancing generalization ability. However, the randomness of Gaussian noise distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE) method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning. Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations, ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2 regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.

Summary: 
Generative models like Flow Matching have shown superior performance but are often limited by computationally expensive iterative sampling processes. Recent research has focused on one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, with MeanFlow being a prominent method. This work introduces the concept of Interval Splitting Consistency, a novel algebraic identity that ensures consistency of the average velocity field across different time intervals. The SplitMeanFlow framework is proposed, which directly enforces this algebraic consistency as a learning objective. It is shown that SplitMeanFlow is a more general approach than MeanFlow, with the latter being a limiting case of the former. The algebraic approach offers improved efficiency by eliminating the need for JVP computations, resulting in simpler implementation, stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. Practical applications of SplitMeanFlow, such as in speech synthesis products like Doubao, have demonstrated significant speedups of up to 20x. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations, resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations.
  Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.

arXiv:2507.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency, model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that, with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

<title>Evaluating Ensemble and Deep Learning Models for Static Malware Detection with Dimensionality Reduction Using the EMBER Dataset</title>

arXiv:2507.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost, show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type. This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.

<title>Text-to-SPARQL Goes Beyond English: Multilingual Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs through Human-Inspired Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones. Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular, interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA. Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for diverse linguistic communities.

Abstract: The exponential growth of DNA sequencing data has outpaced traditional heuristic-based methods, which struggle to scale effectively. Efficient computational approaches are urgently needed to support large-scale similarity search, a foundational task in bioinformatics for detecting homology, functional similarity, and novelty among genomic and proteomic sequences. Although tools like BLAST have been widely used and remain effective in many scenarios, they suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and poor performance on divergent sequences.
  In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn latent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns beyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene embeddings. Unlike prior studies, our analysis focuses on bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking known homologs. Our results highlight both computational advantages (in memory and runtime efficiency) and improved retrieval quality, offering a promising alternative to traditional alignment-heavy tools.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions. The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our method to support its adoption by the broader community.

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced, posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers without the need for retraining the generator.

Abstract: In the era of synthetic media, deepfake manipulations pose a significant threat to information integrity. To address this challenge, we propose TrustDefender, a two-stage framework comprising (i) a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects deepfake imagery in real-time extended reality (XR) streams, and (ii) an integrated succinct zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocol that validates detection results without disclosing raw user data. Our design addresses both the computational constraints of XR platforms while adhering to the stringent privacy requirements in sensitive settings. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark deepfake datasets demonstrate that TrustDefender achieves 95.3% detection accuracy, coupled with efficient proof generation underpinned by rigorous cryptography, ensuring seamless integration with high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By fusing advanced computer vision models with provable security mechanisms, our work establishes a foundation for reliable AI in immersive and privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at https://github.com/apple/ml-agent-evaluator.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series forecasting (TSF) has garnered significant attention among researchers. This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series, marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model. The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets. This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using LLMs based on FTS.

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations (barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

Abstract: We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream application such as animation, toonify, and relighting.

<title>Computational Performance Bounds Prediction in Quantum Computing with Unstable Noise</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds. Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.

<title>Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains. Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives to those obtained via offline RL.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.

<title>Compatibility of Max and Sum Objectives for Committee Selection and $k$-Facility Location</title>

Abstract: We study a version of the metric facility location problem (or, equivalently, variants of the committee selection problem) in which we must choose $k$ facilities in an arbitrary metric space to serve some set of clients $C$. We consider four different objectives, where each client $i\in C$ attempts to minimize either the sum or the maximum of its distance to the chosen facilities, and where the overall objective either considers the sum or the maximum of the individual client costs. Rather than optimizing a single objective at a time, we study how compatible these objectives are with each other, and show the existence of solutions which are simultaneously close-to-optimum for any pair of the above objectives. Our results show that when choosing a set of facilities or a representative committee, it is often possible to form a solution which is good for several objectives at the same time, instead of sacrificing one desideratum to achieve another.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated its applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare, energy optimization, and autonomous driving. However, a critical question remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213% increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82% decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all standalone defense strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding. However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.

<title>SDGOCC: Semantic and Depth-Guided Bird's-Eye View Transformation for 3D Multimodal Occupancy Prediction</title>

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of 3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/DzpLab/SDGOCC.

Abstract: While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\% improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents an untapped \$8.9 billion market opportunity. Our results indicate that future AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing isolated functions.

<title>Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tunes a Sparse Subnetwork in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various areas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to LLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency, especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

Abstract: Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim 0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

Abstract: Building general-purpose intelligent robots has long been a fundamental goal of robotics. A promising approach is to mirror the evolutionary trajectory of humans: learning through continuous interaction with the environment, with early progress driven by the imitation of human behaviors. Achieving this goal presents three core challenges: (1) designing safe robotic hardware with human-level physical capabilities; (2) developing an intuitive and scalable whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection; and (3) creating algorithms capable of learning whole-body visuomotor policies from human demonstrations. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we propose Astribot Suite, a robot learning suite for whole-body manipulation aimed at general daily tasks across diverse environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on a wide range of activities that require whole-body coordination, extensive reachability, human-level dexterity, and agility. Our results show that Astribot's cohesive integration of embodiment, teleoperation interface, and learning pipeline marks a significant step towards real-world, general-purpose whole-body robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent robots.

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships, overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of road participants is a critical task in autonomous driving. In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/LinFunster/JAM to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box" nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI) methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3 modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/SKA-Bench.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the behavior of large-scale multi-agents in games remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper examines the role of heterogeneity in equilibrium formation by analyzing how smooth regret-matching drives a large number of heterogeneous agents with diverse initial policies toward unified behavior. By modeling the system state as a probability distribution of regrets and analyzing its evolution through the continuity equation, we uncover a key phenomenon in diverse multi-agent settings: the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, leading to the disappearance of heterogeneity and the emergence of consensus among agents. This universal result enables us to prove convergence to quantal response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative multi-agent settings. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning and offers a novel perspective on equilibrium selection in diverse game-theoretic scenarios.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment, we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score, 95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes (Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

<title>LLM Meets the Sky: Heuristic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Secure Heterogeneous UAV Networks</title>

Abstract: This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy constraints. Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

<title>Dispatch-Aware Deep Neural Network for Optimal Transmission Switching: Toward Real-Time and Feasibility Guaranteed Operation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17194</link>

Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration, reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished, professional slides.

<title>The Pluralistic Moral Gap: Understanding Judgment and Value Differences between Humans and Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice, which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap, we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

<title>HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Spikes</title>

Abstract: Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

<title>P3SL: Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning on Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7 devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop, using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the environmental impact of FL tasks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component, self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference, DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.

Abstract: Interacting with real-world objects in Mixed Reality (MR) often proves difficult when they are crowded, distant, or partially occluded, hindering straightforward selection and manipulation. We observe that these difficulties stem from performing interaction directly on physical objects, where input is tightly coupled to their physical constraints. Our key insight is to decouple interaction from these constraints by introducing proxies-abstract representations of real-world objects. We embody this concept in Reality Proxy, a system that seamlessly shifts interaction targets from physical objects to their proxies during selection. Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality Proxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical spatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel and previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming, attribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object selections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate Reality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office information retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control. An expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting that proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction paradigm for future MR systems.

Abstract: Prompting foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have enabled new AI-powered software features (e.g., text summarization) that previously were only possible by fine-tuning FMs. Now, developers are embedding prompts in software, known as prompt programs. The process of prompt programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet, the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48 research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions -- including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.

Abstract: Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations (DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors. This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities, outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights, reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency evaluation and diagnosis.

Abstract: Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the Distribution Semantics is a leading approach to practical reasoning under uncertainty. An advantage of the Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable to practical applications.

Abstract: Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.

Abstract: Imitation learning from demonstrations usually suffers from the confounding effects of unmeasured variables (i.e., unmeasured confounders) on the states and actions. If ignoring them, a biased estimation of the policy would be entailed. To break up this confounding gap, in this paper, we take the best of the strong power of instrumental variables (IV) and propose a Confounded Causal Imitation Learning (C2L) model. This model accommodates confounders that influence actions across multiple timesteps, rather than being restricted to immediate temporal dependencies. We develop a two-stage imitation learning framework for valid IV identification and policy optimization. In particular, in the first stage, we construct a testing criterion based on the defined pseudo-variable, with which we achieve identifying a valid IV for the C2L models. Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability conditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we propose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator, while the other is offline. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of identifying the valid IV as well as learning the policy.

Abstract: Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction, continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We validated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex phenomena.

<title>Temporal Point-Supervised Signal Reconstruction: A Human-Annotation-Free Framework for Weak Moving Target Detection</title>

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M). Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for assembling lightweight food image.

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks. However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

<title>SFUOD: Source-Free Unknown Object Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data. While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data, and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection methods in the future.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored graph-based approaches to retrieval-augmented generation, leveraging structured or semi-structured information -- such as entities and their relations extracted from documents -- to enhance retrieval. However, these methods are typically designed to address specific tasks, such as multi-hop question answering and query-focused summarisation, and therefore, there is limited evidence of their general applicability across broader datasets. In this paper, we aim to adapt a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG solution: $\text{GeAR}$ and explore its performance and limitations on the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2) introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3) comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately, our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved diagnostic processes.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds. Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is achievable through projects with smaller cost.

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.

Abstract: Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects
  and dynamic elements like robots and miscellaneous items, showcasing its potential for robust indoor scene understanding.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning, essential in organic synthesis and drug discovery, has greatly benefited from recent AI-driven advancements. Nevertheless, existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model. Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

Abstract: The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional, quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of advanced quantum processors.

BGM-HAN captures multi-level representations that are crucial for nuanced assessment, improving both interpretability and predictive performance. Experimental results on real admissions data demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art baselines from traditional machine learning to large language models, offering a promising framework for augmenting decision-making in domains where structure, context, and fairness matter.

Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.

Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions, yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection (HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks, as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of feasibility and optimality.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology), and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.

Abstract: Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of building energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been explored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely data-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven models, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the data-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain. First, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting the inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and occupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a probabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a real-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the performance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types, but residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on average. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces physically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data. Second, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating quantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.

<title>Federated Majorize-Minimization: Beyond Parameter Aggregation</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified approach for designing stochastic optimization algorithms that robustly scale to the federated learning setting. Our work studies a class of Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, which possesses a linearly parameterized family of majorizing surrogate functions. This framework encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM), which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then extend \SSMM\ to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and communication constraints; this yields \QSMM. The originality of \QSMM\ is to learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the \textit{surrogate majorizing function}, contrary to classical algorithms which learn and aggregate the \textit{original parameter}. Finally, to showcase the flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated setting.

<title>Enhancing Quantum Federated Learning with Fisher Information-Based Optimization</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions. This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum federated averaging method.

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and the code will be at https://maxiuw.github.io/prix.

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored, particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30 participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior, particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

Abstract: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL. However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm. Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as performant as possible.

Abstract: Software obfuscation, particularly prevalent in JavaScript, hinders code comprehension and analysis, posing significant challenges to software testing, static analysis, and malware detection. This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques, eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters, prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems, quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

Abstract: Over the past decade, advances in generative modeling, such as generative adversarial networks, masked autoencoders, and diffusion models, have significantly transformed biological research and discovery, enabling breakthroughs in molecule design, protein generation, drug discovery, and beyond. At the same time, biological applications have served as valuable testbeds for evaluating the capabilities of generative models. Recently, flow matching has emerged as a powerful and efficient alternative to diffusion-based generative modeling, with growing interest in its application to problems in biology and life sciences. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of recent developments in flow matching and its applications in biological domains. We begin by systematically reviewing the foundations and variants of flow matching, and then categorize its applications into three major areas: biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and protein generation. For each, we provide an in-depth review of recent progress. We also summarize commonly used datasets and software tools, and conclude with a discussion of potential future directions. The corresponding curated resources are available at https://github.com/Violet24K/Awesome-Flow-Matching-Meets-Biology.

Abstract: Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic, and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will update monthly to achieve its original goal. Project page: https://stdstu12.github.io/YUME-Project/.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions. This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria. However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models. While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$ relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model scales.

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks, concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions: (1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%) but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need," offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of advanced language models.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Abstract: Temporal facts, which are used to describe events that occur during specific time periods, have become a topic of increased interest in the field of knowledge graph (KG) research. In terms of quality management, the introduction of time restrictions brings new challenges to maintaining the temporal consistency of KGs. Previous studies rely on manually enumerated temporal constraints to detect conflicts, which are labor-intensive and may have granularity issues. To address this problem, we start from the common pattern of temporal facts and propose a pattern-based temporal constraint mining method, PaTeCon. Unlike previous studies, PaTeCon uses graph patterns and statistical information relevant to the given KG to automatically generate temporal constraints, without the need for human experts. In this paper, we illustrate how this method can be optimized to achieve significant speed improvement. We also annotate Wikidata and Freebase to build two new benchmarks for conflict detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our pattern-based automatic constraint mining approach is highly effective in generating valuable temporal constraints.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.

Abstract: Designing two-sided matching mechanisms is challenging when practical demands for matching outcomes are difficult to formalize and the designed mechanism must satisfy theoretical conditions. To address this, prior work has proposed a framework that learns a matching mechanism from examples, using a parameterized family that satisfies properties such as stability. However, despite its usefulness, this framework does not guarantee strategy-proofness (SP), and cannot handle varying numbers of agents or incorporate publicly available contextual information about agents, both of which are crucial in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new parametrized family of matching mechanisms that always satisfy strategy-proofness, are applicable for an arbitrary number of agents, and deal with public contextual information of agents, based on the serial dictatorship (SD). This family is represented by NeuralSD, a novel neural network architecture based on SD, where agent rankings in SD are treated as learnable parameters computed from agents' contexts using an attention-based sub-network. To enable learning, we introduce tensor serial dictatorship (TSD), a differentiable relaxation of SD using tensor operations. This allows NeuralSD to be trained end-to-end from example matchings while satisfying SP. We conducted experiments to learn a matching mechanism from matching examples while satisfying SP. We demonstrated that our method outperformed baselines in predicting matchings and on several metrics for goodness of matching outcomes.

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.

Abstract: Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication. Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation. Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research. Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research. Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zkzhou126/AI-for-Research.

<title>More is Less: The Pitfalls of Multi-Model Synthetic Preference Data in DPO Safety Alignment</title>

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly critical step in post-training. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models like ChatGPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I) has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a system (computer or any other) has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. Threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not. Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass way. We call this novel framework the Turing test 2.0. We then demonstrate real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing test 2.0 framework on modern A.I. models.

Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are adopted by contributors.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are facing the challenges of understanding and following multimodal assembly instructions, particularly when fine-grained spatial reasoning and precise object state detection are required. In this work, we explore LEGO Co-builder, a hybrid benchmark combining real-world LEGO assembly logic with programmatically generated multimodal scenes. The dataset captures stepwise visual states and procedural instructions, allowing controlled evaluation of instruction-following, object detection, and state detection. We introduce a unified framework and assess leading VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen-VL, under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our results reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, with a maximum F1 score of just 40.54\% on state detection, highlighting gaps in fine-grained visual understanding. We release the benchmark, codebase, and generation pipeline to support future research on multimodal assembly assistants grounded in real-world workflows.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.

Abstract: Neural message passing is a basic feature extraction unit for graph-structured data considering neighboring node features in network propagation from one layer to the next. We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ACMP.

Abstract: Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economists have recognized the value of describing the process of decision making in detail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time. For example, the time it takes to decide can reveal more about an agent's true hidden preferences than only the decision itself. Similarly, data that track the ongoing decision process such as eye movements or neural recordings contain critical information that can be exploited, even if no decision is made. Here, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on insights about how decisions emerge over time and incorporate related process data to improve AI predictions in general and human-AI interactions in particular. First, we introduce a highly established computational framework that assumes decisions to emerge from the noisy accumulation of evidence, and we present related empirical work in psychology, neuroscience, and economics. Next, we discuss to what extent current approaches in multi-agent AI do or do not incorporate process data and models of decision making. Finally, we outline how a more principled inclusion of the evidence-accumulation framework into the training and use of AI can help to improve human-AI interactions in the future.

Abstract: Nowadays, reading or writing comments on captivating videos has emerged as a critical part of the viewing experience on online video platforms. However, existing recommender systems primarily focus on users' interaction behaviors with videos, neglecting comment content and interaction in user preference modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR that utilizes user interaction histories with both videos and comments to jointly perform personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: sequential recommendation (SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model functions as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our method for efficient user preference modeling. Concurrently, we employ a LLM as the supplemental recommender (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying user preferences derived from heterogeneous interaction behaviors. In order to integrate the strengths of the SR model and the supplemental LLM recommender, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. The first stage, personalized preference alignment, aims to align the preference representations from both components, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR model. The second stage, recommendation-oriented fine-tuning, involves fine-tuning the alignment-enhanced SR model according to specific objectives. Extensive experiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LSVCR. Moreover, online A/B testing on KuaiShou platform verifies the practical benefits of our approach. In particular, we attain a cumulative gain of 4.13% in comment watch time.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for context-grounded tasks like summarization and question-answering, understanding what makes an LLM produce a certain response is challenging. We propose Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models (MExGen), a technique to provide explanations for context-grounded text generation. MExGen assigns scores to parts of the context to quantify their influence on the model's output. It extends attribution methods like LIME and SHAP to LLMs used in context-grounded tasks where (1) inference cost is high, (2) input text is long, and (3) the output is text. We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations. We open-source code for MExGen as part of the ICX360 toolkit: https://github$.$com/IBM/ICX360.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the critical need to enhance security measures against adversarial attacks and protect QML models becomes increasingly evident. In this work, we outline the connection between quantum noise channels and differential privacy (DP), by constructing a family of noise channels which are inherently $\epsilon$-DP: $(\alpha, \gamma)$-channels. Through this approach, we successfully replicate the $\epsilon$-DP bounds observed for depolarizing and random rotation channels, thereby affirming the broad generality of our framework. Additionally, we use a semi-definite program to construct an optimally robust channel. In a small-scale experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of using our optimal noise channel over depolarizing noise, particularly in enhancing adversarial accuracy. Moreover, we assess how the variables $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ affect the certifiable robustness and investigate how different encoding methods impact the classifier's robustness.

Abstract: Stickers are increasingly used in social media to express sentiment and intent. Despite their significant impact on sentiment analysis and intent recognition, little research has been conducted in this area. To address this gap, we propose a new task: \textbf{M}ultimodal chat \textbf{S}entiment \textbf{A}nalysis and \textbf{I}ntent \textbf{R}ecognition involving \textbf{S}tickers (MSAIRS). Additionally, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset containing Chinese chat records and stickers excerpted from several mainstream social media platforms. Our dataset includes paired data with the same text but different stickers, the same sticker but different contexts, and various stickers consisting of the same images with different texts, allowing us to better understand the impact of stickers on chat sentiment and intent. We also propose an effective multimodal joint model, MMSAIR, featuring differential vector construction and cascaded attention mechanisms for enhanced multimodal fusion. Our experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of jointly modeling sentiment and intent, as they mutually reinforce each other's recognition accuracy. MMSAIR significantly outperforms traditional models and advanced MLLMs, demonstrating the challenge and uniqueness of sticker interpretation in social media. Our dataset and code are available on https://github.com/FakerBoom/MSAIRS-Dataset.

<title>Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild</title>

arXiv:2409.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.

<title>BadHMP: Backdoor Attack against Human Motion Prediction</title>

Abstract: Precise future human motion prediction over sub-second horizons from past observations is crucial for various safety-critical applications. To date, only a few studies have examined the vulnerability of skeleton-based neural networks to evasion and backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose BadHMP, a novel backdoor attack that targets specifically human motion prediction tasks. Our approach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized backdoor trigger in one limb of the skeleton, causing selected joints to follow predefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences are globally modified that all the joints move following the target trajectories. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee the smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy enough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model unobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target sequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even with a low poisoned sample injection ratio. Experimental results on two datasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap) and two network architectures (LTD and HRI) demonstrate the high-fidelity, effectiveness, and stealthiness of BadHMP. Robustness of our attack against fine-tuning defense is also verified.

<title>Language model developers should report train-test overlap</title>

Abstract: Language models are extensively evaluated, but correctly interpreting evaluation results requires knowledge of train-test overlap which refers to the extent to which the language model is trained on the very data it is being tested on. The public currently lacks adequate information about train-test overlap: most models have no public train-test overlap statistics, and third parties cannot directly measure train-test overlap since they do not have access to the training data. To make this clear, we document the practices of 30 model developers, finding that just 9 developers report train-test overlap: 4 developers release training data under open-source licenses, enabling the community to directly measure train-test overlap, and 5 developers publish their train-test overlap methodology and statistics. By engaging with language model developers, we provide novel information about train-test overlap for three additional developers. Overall, we take the position that language model developers should publish train-test overlap statistics and/or training data whenever they report evaluation results on public test sets. We hope our work increases transparency into train-test overlap to increase the community-wide trust in model evaluations.

<title>Vascular Segmentation of Functional Ultrasound Images using Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Segmentation of medical images is a fundamental task with numerous applications. While MRI, CT, and PET modalities have significantly benefited from deep learning segmentation techniques, more recent modalities, like functional ultrasound (fUS), have seen limited progress. fUS is a non invasive imaging method that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with high spatio-temporal resolution. However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in fUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking microbubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV quantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based segmentation tool for fUS images, capable of differentiating signals from different vascular compartments, based on ULM automatic annotation and enabling dynamic CBV quantification. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS images of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90% accuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames from a fUS stack. These results are comparable to those from tubular structure segmentation in other imaging modalities. Additionally, models trained on resting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual stimulation, highlighting robustness. This work offers a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to ULM, enhancing fUS data interpretation and improving understanding of vessel function. Our pipeline shows high linear correlation coefficients between signals from predicted and actual compartments in both cortical and deeper regions, showcasing its ability to accurately capture blood flow dynamics.

Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.

Abstract: Performing complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments requires efficient Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches that combine high-level symbolic plans with low-level motion control. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which limits adaptability to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel Onto-LLM-TAMP framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task-contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments and the generation of semantically correct task plans.

<title>NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References</title>

Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).

Abstract: Seasickness poses a widespread problem that adversely impacts both passenger comfort and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. Although attention shift has been proposed as a potential method to alleviate symptoms of motion sickness, its efficacy remains to be rigorously validated, especially in maritime environments. In this study, we develop an AI-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) to realize sustained and practical attention shift by incorporating tasks such as breath counting. Forty-three participants completed a real-world nautical experiment consisting of a real-feedback session, a resting session, and a pseudo-feedback session. Notably, 81.39\% of the participants reported that the BCI intervention was effective. EEG analysis revealed that the proposed system can effectively regulate motion sickness EEG signatures, such as an decrease in total band power, along with an increase in theta relative power and a decrease in beta relative power. Furthermore, an indicator of attentional focus, the theta/beta ratio, exhibited a significant reduction during the real-feedback session, providing further evidence to support the effectiveness of the BCI in shifting attention. Collectively, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, which has the potential to open up a brand-new application domain for BCIs.

<title>RALAD: Bridging the Real-to-Sim Domain Gap in Autonomous Driving with Retrieval-Augmented Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12296</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.12296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust autonomous driving systems, models trained on real-world datasets often struggle to adapt to new environments, particularly when confronted with corner cases such as extreme weather conditions. Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiachengZuo/RALAD.git.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image, which is the first to incorporate reflection in autoregressive image generation. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables distributed agents to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without a central server, through local computation and peer-to-peer communication. Although each agent retains its dataset locally, sharing local models can still expose private information about the local training datasets to adversaries. To mitigate privacy attacks, a common strategy is to inject random artificial noise at each agent before exchanging local models between neighbors. However, this often leads to utility degradation due to the negative effects of cumulated artificial noise on the learning algorithm. In this work, we introduce CorN-DSGD, a novel covariance-based framework for generating correlated privacy noise across agents, which unifies several state-of-the-art methods as special cases. By leveraging network topology and mixing weights, CorN-DSGD optimizes the noise covariance to achieve network-wide noise cancellation. Experimental results show that CorN-DSGD cancels more noise than existing pairwise correlation schemes, improving model performance under formal privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Mobility performance has been a key focus in cellular networks up to 5G. To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.

Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets and their features is essential for structure-based drug design and effective downstream docking. Here, we present RAPID-Net, a deep learning-based algorithm designed for the accurate prediction of binding pockets and seamless integration with docking pipelines. On the PoseBusters benchmark, RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 54.9% of Top-1 poses with RMSD < 2 A and satisfying the PoseBusters chemical-validity criterion, compared to 49.1% for DiffBindFR. On the most challenging time split of PoseBusters aiming to assess generalization ability (structures submitted after September 30, 2021), RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 53.1% of Top-1 poses with RMSD < 2 A and PB-valid, versus 59.5% for AlphaFold 3. Notably, in 92.2% of cases, RAPID-Net-guided Vina samples at least one pose with RMSD < 2 A (regardless of its rank), indicating that pose ranking, rather than sampling, is the primary accuracy bottleneck. The lightweight inference, scalability, and competitive accuracy of RAPID-Net position it as a viable option for large-scale virtual screening campaigns. Across diverse benchmark datasets, RAPID-Net outperforms other pocket prediction tools, including PUResNet and Kalasanty, in both docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of RAPID-Net to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics by highlighting its performance on pharmacologically relevant targets. RAPID-Net accurately identifies distal functional sites, offering new opportunities for allosteric inhibitor design. In the case of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, RAPID-Net uncovers a wider array of potential binding pockets than existing predictors, which typically annotate only the orthosteric pocket and overlook secondary cavities.

Abstract: While autoregressive speech token generation models produce speech with remarkable variety and naturalness, their inherent lack of controllability often results in issues such as hallucinations and undesired vocalizations that do not conform to conditioning inputs. We introduce Koel-TTS, a suite of enhanced encoder-decoder Transformer TTS models that address these challenges by incorporating preference alignment techniques guided by automatic speech recognition and speaker verification models. Additionally, we incorporate classifier-free guidance to further improve synthesis adherence to the transcript and reference speaker audio. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizations significantly enhance target speaker similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness of synthesized speech. Notably, Koel-TTS directly maps text and context audio to acoustic tokens, and on the aforementioned metrics, outperforms state-of-the-art TTS models, despite being trained on a significantly smaller dataset. Audio samples and demos are available on our website.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.

Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable performance in generating high quality images. However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at https://yanoyoshiki.github.io/ICCO/.

Abstract: Political advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and influencing electoral outcomes, often through subtle persuasive techniques embedded in broader propaganda strategies. Detecting these persuasive elements is crucial for enhancing voter awareness and ensuring transparency in democratic processes. This paper presents an integrated approach that bridges model development and real-world application through two interconnected studies. First, we introduce a lightweight model for persuasive text detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance in Subtask 3 of SemEval 2023 Task 3 while requiring significantly fewer computational resources and training data than existing methods. Second, we demonstrate the model's practical utility by collecting the Australian Federal Election 2022 Facebook Ads (APA22) dataset, partially annotating a subset for persuasion, and fine-tuning the model to adapt from mainstream news to social media content. We then apply the fine-tuned model to label the remainder of the APA22 dataset, revealing distinct patterns in how political campaigns leverage persuasion through different funding strategies, word choices, demographic targeting, and temporal shifts in persuasion intensity as election day approaches. Our findings not only underscore the necessity of domain-specific modeling for analyzing persuasion on social media but also show how uncovering these strategies can enhance transparency, inform voters, and promote accountability in digital campaigns.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

<title>Attention-Based Multiscale Temporal Fusion Network for Uncertain-Mode Fault Diagnosis in Multimode Processes</title>

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in multimode processes plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial systems across multiple modes. It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.

<title>Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815</link>

Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.

Abstract: This report provides a detailed comparison between the Safety and Security measures proposed in the EU AI Act's General-Purpose AI (GPAI) Code of Practice (Third Draft) and the current commitments and practices voluntarily adopted by leading AI companies. As the EU moves toward enforcing binding obligations for GPAI model providers, the Code of Practice will be key for bridging legal requirements with concrete technical commitments. Our analysis focuses on the draft's Safety and Security section (Commitments II.1-II.16), documenting excerpts from current public-facing documents that are relevant to each individual measure.
  We systematically reviewed different document types, such as companies' frontier safety frameworks and model cards, from over a dozen companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and others. This report is not meant to be an indication of legal compliance, nor does it take any prescriptive viewpoint about the Code of Practice or companies' policies. Instead, it aims to inform the ongoing dialogue between regulators and General-Purpose AI model providers by surfacing evidence of industry precedent for various measures. Nonetheless, we were able to find relevant quotes from at least 5 companies' documents for the majority of the measures in Commitments II.1-II.16.

Abstract: Ophthalmic diseases pose a significant global health challenge, yet traditional diagnosis methods and existing single-eye deep learning approaches often fail to account for binocular pathological correlations. To address this, we propose DMS-Net, a dual-modal multi-scale Siamese network for binocular fundus image classification. Our framework leverages weight-shared Siamese ResNet-152 backbones to extract deep semantic features from paired fundus images. To tackle challenges such as lesion boundary ambiguity and scattered pathological distributions, we introduce a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Module (MSCAM) that integrates adaptive pooling and attention mechanisms for multi-resolution feature aggregation. Additionally, a Dual-Modal Feature Fusion (DMFF) module enhances cross-modal interaction through spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention, effectively combining global context and local edge features. Evaluated on the ODIR-5K dataset, DMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.9% accuracy, 84.5% recall, and 83.2% Cohen's kappa, demonstrating superior capability in detecting symmetric pathologies and advancing clinical decision-making for ocular diseases.

<title>Machine Learning-Based Modeling of the Anode Heel Effect in X-ray Beam Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

Abstract: To develop a machine learning-based framework for accurately modeling the anode heel effect in Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray imaging systems, enabling realistic beam intensity profiles with minimal experimental calibration. Multiple regression models were trained to predict spatial intensity variations along the anode-cathode axis using experimentally acquired weights derived from beam measurements across different tube potentials. These weights captured the asymmetry introduced by the anode heel effect. A systematic fine-tuning protocol was established to minimize the number of required measurements while preserving model accuracy. The models were implemented in the OpenGATE 10 and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits to evaluate their integration feasibility and predictive performance. Among the tested models, gradient boosting regression (GBR) delivered the highest accuracy, with prediction errors remaining below 5% across all energy levels. The optimized fine-tuning strategy required only six detector positions per energy level, reducing measurement effort by 65%. The maximum error introduced through this fine-tuning process remained below 2%. Dose actor comparisons within Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the GBR-based model closely replicated clinical beam profiles and significantly outperformed conventional symmetric beam models. This study presents a robust and generalizable method for incorporating the anode heel effect into Monte Carlo simulations using machine learning. By enabling accurate, energy-dependent beam modeling with limited calibration data, the approach enhances simulation realism for applications in clinical dosimetry, image quality assessment, and radiation protection.

Abstract: The widespread use of Exogenous Organic Matter in agriculture necessitates monitoring to assess its effects on soil and crop health. This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85. The findings highlight the potential of combining remote sensing and ML for scalable and cost-effective monitoring of EOM applications, supporting precision agriculture and sustainability.

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology is progressively transforming traditional car driving methods, marking a significant milestone in modern transportation. Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving traffic efficiency, and facilitating effective emergency responses. However, current technologies such as radar for environmental perception, cameras for road perception, and vehicle sensor networks face notable challenges, including high costs, vulnerability to weather and lighting conditions, and limited resolution.To address these limitations, this paper presents an improved autonomous target detection network based on YOLOv8. By integrating structural reparameterization technology, a bidirectional pyramid structure network model, and a novel detection pipeline into the YOLOv8 framework, the proposed approach achieves highly efficient and precise detection of multi-scale, small, and remote objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model can effectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of 65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved model holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is well-suited for autonomous driving competitions, such as the Formula Student Autonomous China (FSAC), particularly excelling in scenarios involving single-target and small-object detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology, super-resolution image reconstruction is of great research and practical significance. Existing deep learning methods have made progress but still face limitations in handling complex scenes and preserving image details. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning method for remote sensing image super-resolution. The method constructs a reinforcement learning environment with states, actions, and rewards, optimizing decision objectives through proximal policy optimization (PPO) during the reverse denoising process of the LDM model. Experiments on the RESISC45 dataset show significant improvements over the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, with PSNR increasing by 3-4dB, SSIM improving by 0.08-0.11, and LPIPS reducing by 0.06-0.10, particularly in structured and complex natural scenes. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing super-resolution quality and adaptability across scenes.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code has been released in https://github.com/microsoft/DeepVideoDiscovery.

Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in combination with deep learning shows promise for many high-impact automated diagnostic and prognostic tools. However, training new models requires large amounts of labeled data, a challenge due to high cost of precise annotations and data privacy. To address this issue, we introduce the MRI-CORE, a vision foundation model trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110 thousand MRI volumes across 18 body locations. Our experiments show notable improvements in performance over state-of-the-art methods in 13 data-restricted segmentation tasks, as well as in image classification, and zero-shot segmentation, showing the strong potential of MRI-CORE to enable data-efficient development of artificial intelligence models. We also present data on which strategies yield most useful foundation models and a novel analysis relating similarity between pre-training and downstream task data with transfer learning performance. Our model is publicly available with a permissive license.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly propelled the performance of ECG arrhythmia classification, yet its clinical adoption remains hindered by challenges in interpretability and deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, we propose EXGnet, a novel and reliable ECG arrhythmia classification network tailored for single-lead signals, specifically designed to balance high accuracy, explainability, and edge compatibility. EXGnet integrates XAI supervision during training via a normalized cross-correlation based loss, directing the model's attention to clinically relevant ECG regions, similar to a cardiologist's focus. This supervision is driven by automatically generated ground truth, derived through an innovative heart rate variability-based approach, without the need for manual annotation. To enhance classification accuracy without compromising deployment simplicity, we incorporate quantitative ECG features during training. These enrich the model with multi-domain knowledge but are excluded during inference, keeping the model lightweight for edge deployment. Additionally, we introduce an innovative multiresolution block to efficiently capture both short and long-term signal features while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous evaluation on the Chapman and Ningbo benchmark datasets validates the supremacy of EXGnet, which achieves average five-fold accuracies of 98.762% and 96.932%, and F1-scores of 97.910% and 95.527%, respectively. Comprehensive ablation studies and both quantitative and qualitative interpretability assessment confirm that the XAI guidance is pivotal, demonstrably enhancing the model's focus and trustworthiness. Overall, EXGnet sets a new benchmark by combining high-performance arrhythmia classification with interpretability, paving the way for more trustworthy and accessible portable ECG based health monitoring systems.

<title>LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions, such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework, we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently. Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public interest and engagement with scientific content.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

arXiv:2507.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.

<title>Prompt Guidance and Human Proximal Perception for HOT Prediction with Regional Joint Loss</title>

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless, current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text. Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss (RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets. Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$, \textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.

<title>How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955</link>

arXiv:2507.01955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.

<title>Cautious Next Token Prediction</title>

arXiv:2507.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

arXiv:2507.04224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of 832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to 128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50, VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC. U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice: 0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/SFM.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FDAM.

<div> Keywords: coordinated online behavior, multimodal approach, detection, digital platforms, analysis

Summary:
This study explores the detection of coordinated online behavior using multimodal approaches. Traditional methods often focus on single types of interactions or consider multiple modalities independently, potentially missing the complex dynamics of multimodal coordination. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, the study highlights the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated models in capturing coordination patterns. The research reveals that not all modalities provide unique insights, but a multimodal approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. The findings enhance the ability to detect and analyze coordinated behavior online, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms. <div>

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To address this, we introduce GitChameleon 2.0, a novel, meticulously curated dataset comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon 2.0 rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51% range, underscoring the intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon 2.0 enables a clearer understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-Thought, Diligent Learner, Reasoning, Large Language Models, Problem-solving

Summary:
The paper introduces the Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm designed to tackle the challenges of Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models. It identifies key obstacles in CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of embedded search, and exponential inference costs. The Diligent Learner models reasoning as a depth-first search guided by a validator, supporting backtracking upon failure. The framework is proven to efficiently learn from CoT data under mild assumptions, where existing methods struggle. This approach opens up possibilities for building scalable and reliable reasoning systems trained on incomplete data, leading to the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust and interpretable problem-solving capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) -- often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust, interpretable problem-solving abilities.

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenges faced by the food production industry, particularly the meat processing sector, exacerbated by the recent energy crisis in the European Union. It focuses on optimizing the purchase and processing of materials for a meat processing company, considering alternative processing methods, stock expiration dates, minimum order quantity, and minimum percentage constraints. The authors prove that these constraints make the problem NP-hard and propose a simple iterative approach based on integer linear programming to solve real-life instances efficiently. This approach also addresses numerical issues encountered with commercial solvers. Real data tests demonstrate that the algorithm can find optimal solutions within seconds for various scenarios in the meat processing industry. <div>

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a few seconds for all considered use cases.

<div> Keywords: ADAS-equipped vehicles, driving data, safety-critical corner cases, Large Language Model, scenario understanding

Summary: 
The article focuses on the challenge of identifying safety-critical driving scenarios from the increasing amount of data collected by Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)-equipped vehicles. By analyzing braking events, the research aims to understand the reasons why vehicles brake. Traditional approaches rely on rule-based heuristics, but these lack generalization in complex urban environments. The proposed framework utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) to interpret and classify driving scenarios, bridging the gap between numerical signals and natural language descriptions. The method includes a dual-path scenario retrieval system, allowing for category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown scenarios. The evaluation is conducted on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to rule-based approaches and good generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

arXiv:2507.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA, incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

Summary: 
This article explores the relative merits and interactions of short-term and long-term trend-following rules used by Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). Through a Bayesian graphical model, the study dynamically decomposes CTA returns into short-term trend, long-term trend, and market beta factors. The research sheds light on how blending different horizons shapes the strategy's risk-adjusted performance, a topic that has been controversial in the field. By analyzing the decomposition of returns, the paper contributes to the ongoing debate on trend-following strategies and their effectiveness in capturing major directional moves in the market. The findings provide valuable insights for CTAs looking to optimize their trading strategies based on different time horizons. <div>

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

Summary:
Execution-guided neural program synthesis was compared to test-time fine-tuning (TTFT) in a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the open-world ARC-AGI domain. The study aimed to assess the ability to generalize out-of-distribution, crucial for success in this domain. The findings showed that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperformed all reference algorithms in composing novel solutions. Additionally, the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI was attributed to eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM failed to utilize directly. <div>

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on directly.

<div> Keywords: Intelligence, Recursive Coherence Principle, Functional Model of Intelligence, Semantic coherence, AI alignment <br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of structural coherence in intelligence, whether biological, artificial, or collective. It introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP), which states that for any reasoning system to scale effectively, semantic coherence must be preserved through a recursive evaluable generalization operator. The Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) is identified as the essential operator that satisfies the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal, composable architecture with internal and external functions crucial for maintaining semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. The lack of the FMI can lead to recursive coherence breakdown, resulting in common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and instability. The RCP captures the internal, recursive dynamics necessary for coherent and alignable intelligence, offering a pathway for safe and robustly coherent AI at scale. The article advocates for a shift from behavioral constraints to structural coherence in AI alignment. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal, composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling, adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions (storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

Summary:<br />
The article proposes a new framework called ADEPTS to guide the development of AI agents with a focus on user-facing capabilities. ADEPTS is based on six principles for human-centered design, ensuring AI agents are understandable, controllable, and trustworthy in everyday use. Unlike existing frameworks, ADEPTS bridges the gap between technical development and user experience, providing actionable guidance for researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers. By condensing complex AI-UX requirements into a compact framework, ADEPTS aims to accelerate the improvement of agent capabilities, facilitate the design of user experiences, and establish a shared language for tracking progress in AI agent development. <div>
arXiv:2507.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents, assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress around the development of AI agents.

Summary: <br />
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents (RBAMAs), which are designed to make ethical decisions based on sound normative reasoning. RBAMAs extend the reinforcement learning architecture to incorporate the capacity to learn a reason-theory through case-based feedback, enabling them to derive moral obligations and adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these obligations. This framework contributes to the moral justifiability, moral robustness, and moral trustworthiness of the agents, making them ethically sound in their actions. The study presents an initial implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates its potential through experiments. These RBAMAs provide a concrete and deployable framework for the development of artificial moral agents that meet key ethical standards. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy. This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents (RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

Summary: 
Ethical considerations surrounding the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household settings, particularly in the form of proactive autonomous agents, present various challenges and opportunities for comfort and attention. The shift towards proactive autonomy raises concerns regarding privacy, fairness, and user control. This article examines responsible innovation frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to provide practical guidance for the development of ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user groups, such as the elderly, children, and neurodivergent individuals, are at higher risk of surveillance, bias, and privacy violations when utilizing agentic AI. Design recommendations include tailored explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls, utilizing participatory and inclusive methodologies. Additionally, the article discusses how data-driven insights, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) for social media analysis, can inform user needs and ethical considerations in the development of transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI for household automation.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments, especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy, privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls, supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household automation.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors explore the impact of inference-time computation scaling on model robustness in smaller-scale, open-source reasoning models. They introduce a budget forcing strategy to improve robustness in models like DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, and Phi-reasoning. The study challenges the assumption that intermediate reasoning steps are hidden from adversaries and uncovers a security risk when these steps become accessible. They find that increased inference-time computation can actually decrease model robustness in the presence of explicit reasoning steps. Furthermore, they discuss vulnerabilities in models with tool-integrated reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. The research highlights the nuanced trade-offs involved in deploying inference-time scaling in real-world security-sensitive applications, emphasizing the importance of considering the adversarial setting and deployment context. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible, increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness. Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

The proposed BikeMAN model, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network, aims to accurately predict station-level bike traffic for entire systems. The network comprises an encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanisms capturing spatial and temporal correlations in bike station features. Through experiments on New York City's bike sharing data, the network demonstrates high accuracy in predicting traffic for over 700 stations. This research fills a gap in efficient bike sharing system management by providing accurate and comprehensive station-level traffic predictions with spatial-temporal complexities in mind. <div>

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.

<div> problem-solving paradigms, formal languages, natural language, trust index, statistical quality dimensions
Summary: 
The article discusses the shift from classical computation to Large Language Models (LLMs) in addressing human problems characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context. It introduces a framework to contrast problem spaces addressable by formal languages versus natural language, highlighting the need for nuanced definitions of approximate solution space for natural language problems. A vector-valued trust index Q is introduced to distinguish between binary quality measures for formal solutions and the continuous adequacy spectrum for natural language solutions. Two statistical quality dimensions, normalized bi-semantic entropy and emotional valence, are proposed to measure the robustness, conceptual diversity, and subjective valuation of LLM answers. These concepts aim to provide a more rigorous understanding of the capabilities and limitations of problem-solving using natural language in the era of LLMs.

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations. Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of LLMs.

<br />Summary: <br />
This article introduces an extension of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) that incorporates negation in the body, unifying previous extensions such as fuzzy constraint satisfaction and uncertainty. The semantics of these programs are provided using approximation fixpoint theory, analyzing the impact of semiring properties on the resulting semantics. By unifying existing approaches and allowing for a more expressive language, this framework extends the capabilities of CLP to solve complex problems requiring constraint consideration. <div>

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows extending them with a more expressive language.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques have shown significant potential in AI for solving complex problems, especially in math and coding domains. However, their application in domain-specific areas like battery discovery has been limited. A new agentic framework called ChatBattery integrates domain knowledge to guide LLMs in materials design for lithium-ion batteries. Using ChatBattery, three novel cathode materials with significant capacity improvements over the widely used NMC811 material were identified, synthesized, and characterized successfully. This AI-driven cycle, from design to synthesis to characterization, demonstrates the transformative impact of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials discovery. ChatBattery sets a precedent for LLM-driven reasoning-based platforms in domain-specific applications, showcasing the effectiveness of guided search techniques in advancing materials science. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials discovery.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenge of using AI to file personal income taxes in the United States. It introduces TaxCalcBench, a benchmark for evaluating models' performance in tax return calculations. The experiment showed that state-of-the-art models struggle in accurately computing federal income tax returns, demonstrating limitations in understanding tax tables, calculating taxes, and determining eligibility. The analysis suggests the need for improved infrastructure to enhance the accuracy of Language Model (LLMs) when applied to tax calculation tasks. The study highlights the complexity of the tax filing process, emphasizing the ongoing development required to enable AI to effectively handle such intricate tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Can AI file your taxes? Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench, a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation task.

Summary: 
SpiroLLM is a novel multimodal large language model designed to understand spirograms and aid in the diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). By incorporating morphological features from respiratory curves and aligning them with pulmonary function test numerical values, SpiroLLM can generate comprehensive diagnostic reports with a high level of accuracy, as indicated by a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980. Additionally, in a robustness test with missing core data, SpiroLLM demonstrated a 100% valid response rate compared to a text-only model's 13.4%, highlighting its superior multimodal design. This innovative approach of combining physiological signals with large language models paves the way for more interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools, offering potential benefits for early detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases like COPD.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

<div> Keywords: AI agent architecture, cognitive theories, practical design, structural convergence, meta-architecture 

Summary: 
The article discusses the discovery of a structural convergence in four prominent theories of mind within a practical AI agent architecture known as Agentic Flow. This architecture consists of five modules arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop, showing similarities with predictive processing, associative recall, and error-sensitive control found in the cognitive theories of Kahneman, Friston, Minsky, and Clark. Experimental results comparing the structured agent with baseline systems on multi-step reasoning tasks demonstrate higher task success and constraint adherence. The introduction of PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture captures design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow, providing a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures shaped by real-world implementation demands. The paper serves as a position paper that explores how implementation choices can reveal underlying structural similarities with cognitive theories, without claiming theoretical unification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow. Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical unification.

Summary:<br />
The research proposes a Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) architecture utilizing multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) to address energy shortages of low-Earth orbit satellites, considering communication and computing energy consumption. A joint optimization problem is formulated for MF-RIS and SAGIN parameters. To solve this non-convex problem, a compressed hybrid intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework is introduced. Simulation results show that the CHIMERA scheme outperforms conventional benchmarks in terms of energy efficiency. The proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture offers superior energy efficiency performance compared to standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments, due to its complementary coverage and efficient exploration of complex actions. <div>

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Summary:
<br />
In this study, the authors evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) enabled by Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). They conduct experiments using TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations to assess the tokens per second performance. The results show that distilled models like DeepSeek outperform others due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Quantized models with 4-bit and 8-bit quantization exhibit up to a 3x performance gain compared to FP16 models. The TDX implementation surpasses the CPU version for certain parameter sets, highlighting efficient computation execution in a secure environment. Validation tests using a testbench for System-on-Chip (SoC) design tasks demonstrate the potential of deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor Computer-Aided Design (CAD) applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained models and their associated training data are considered confidential intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model (LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\% expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality, with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a new perspective in AI research evaluation for a novel pattern of scientific collaboration: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ResearcherBench.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, multi-modal learning, knowledge distillation, feature level, classifier level 

Summary: 
In the field of deep learning, improving model performance by increasing its size can be inefficient. Multi-modal learning, which combines different types of information as input, can enhance performance. This study introduces a cross-modal distillation framework for knowledge transfer between different modalities such as image, text, and speech. Traditional hard constrained loss methods can lead to overfitting in cross-modal distillation, so the study proposes two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature and classifier levels. Additionally, a quality-based adaptive weights module is introduced to enhance model training by weighing input samples based on data quality. Experimental results on speaker recognition and image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in transferring knowledge across diverse modalities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

<div> Keywords: medical LLM benchmarks, African deployment, neglected tropical diseases, guideline alignment, Alama Health QA <br />
Summary: 
Existing medical LLM benchmarks do not adequately reflect the disease burden and guidelines of African settings, potentially affecting the validity of model evaluation and deployment. A systematic review of 31 evaluation papers identified 19 benchmarks, with Alama Health QA developed using Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines performing the best in capturing neglected tropical disease mentions. Key findings showed disparities in representation of African diseases across benchmarks, with Alama Health QA scoring highest in clinical relevance and guideline alignment. The study highlights the importance of regionally curated resources like Alama Health QA to ensure safe and equitable model evaluation and deployment in African health systems. Additional emphasis on guideline alignment and disease-specific derivatives is essential for improving the accuracy and applicability of medical LLM benchmarks in African contexts.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31 quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB (5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility. Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health systems.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, which are an extension of ordinary Gauge Flow Models by incorporating an L∞-algebra to include higher geometries and symmetries associated with higher groups. Experimental results on a Gaussian Mixture Model dataset demonstrated significant performance improvements compared to traditional Flow Models. The Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage the extended Lie Algebra to enhance the generative flow modeling process, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of complex data distributions. The integration of higher geometries and symmetries provides a more effective framework for capturing and modeling complex patterns in data, leading to improved performance in generating samples. This novel approach opens up new possibilities for incorporating advanced mathematical concepts into flow modeling, offering a promising pathway for enhancing generative modeling techniques. <div>

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver health information, particularly targeting underserved communities, demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around $6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm, indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.

<div> Counterfactual reasoning, causal models, individual-wise fairness, Markovian setting, counterfactual models.<br />Summary: Counterfactual reasoning deals with answering hypothetical questions about causation, influencing concepts like individual fairness. The article proposes a new approach called counterfactual models, which allow for formalizing and implementing various counterfactual beliefs within a causal framework. These models provide a way to represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model and enable analysts to choose a counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions. A normalization procedure is introduced to describe and implement different counterfactual conceptions without altering observational and interventional constraints. This approach simplifies the process by only requiring a choice of counterfactual conception, without the need to estimate model content. The article illustrates the significance of counterfactuals in causality and demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach through theoretical and numerical examples. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like ''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore, providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover, the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach on theoretical and numerical examples.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces ColaUntangle, a new framework for untangling commits in software development. It addresses the issue of developers producing tangled commits that mix unrelated changes. ColaUntangle utilizes a multi-agent architecture with agents specializing in explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. It integrates Large Language Models to capture both symbolic and semantic depth in code relationships. The framework, evaluated on C# and Java datasets, outperformed existing baselines, showing a significant improvement in untangling efficiency. The results emphasize the effectiveness of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for automated commit untangling tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based, have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG), enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.

<div> Keywords: Inductive Logic Programming, Meta-Interpretive Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, Second Order Definite Normal Form, Poker

Summary:
Self-Supervised Inductive Logic Programming introduces a new learning setting where a background theory or negative examples are not provided for the learning process. A new MIL algorithm called Poker is developed to address this challenge by learning from positive labeled examples and generating new positive and negative examples automatically. By utilizing a Second Order Definite Normal Form (SONF) as a general second-order background theory, the need for task-specific theories is eliminated. Comparing Poker to existing systems like Louise in grammar learning tasks, Poker's performance improves as the number of generated examples increases, while Louise struggles due to the lack of negative examples, leading to over-generalization. This approach signifies a step towards efficient and adaptable ILP systems that can learn effectively in diverse settings without the need for expert-tailored inputs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled, and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels, new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples, over-generalises.

<div> Keywords: large language models, pre-training data detection, neural activation patterns, bias detection, benchmarking <br />
Summary: <br />
The article addresses concerns around the training data of large language models (LLMs) and the biases they might internalize. It introduces a novel algorithm called NA-PDD that analyzes neuron activation patterns in LLMs to detect specific data in their pre-training corpus. The algorithm outperforms existing methods by focusing on differential neuron activation between training and non-training data. Additionally, the article introduces CCNewsPDD, a benchmark that ensures consistent time distributions between training and non-training data, providing a more rigorous evaluation. Through experiments, it is demonstrated that NA-PDD is effective in identifying pre-training data in multiple LLMs and outperforms existing techniques. The proposed approach aims to address legal and ethical concerns related to copyrighted or private data, as well as dataset contamination and bias internalization in LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information, raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss, resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

Summary: 
In the study, the concept of combining model-based and model-free capabilities in an autonomous agent is explored. A model is a theory describing the environment and agent actions' effects. Model-based agents can plan using predictions but require knowing the environment state, while model-free agents can act without planning. The researchers developed an agent using Meta-Interpretive Learning to train a model-based Solver and a model-free Controller. Testing on grid navigation problems in various environments showed that both agents were equivalent in problem-solving ability, indicating the Controller could solve tasks like the Solver. The experiments were conducted on randomly-generated mazes and lake maps with open spaces, demonstrating the combined agent's effectiveness in navigating unknown environments. <div>

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver. We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes, and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are equivalent.

<div> Keywords: Operating Room Scheduling, Answer Set Programming, Machine Learning Algorithms, Surgery Duration Prediction, Robust Schedules

Summary: 
The paper addresses the Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem using a combination of machine learning algorithms and Answer Set Programming (ASP). The ORS problem involves optimizing daily surgery schedules with various constraints. While existing ASP solutions can verify alignments with real data and suggest alternative schedules, they cannot generate provisional schedules or ensure robustness. To overcome this limitation, the paper integrates inductive techniques like machine learning to predict surgery duration based on historical data, enabling the computation of provisional schedules. Additionally, the confidence of these predictions is used as input to enhance the generation of more robust schedules. The approach was validated using historical data from ASL1 Liguria in Italy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the integration. The study is currently under consideration for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then, we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm the viability of our integration.

<div> Variational Inference, Reinforcement Learning, Hierarchical Framework, Abstract Reasoning, Latent Space  
Summary:  
Large Language Models have demonstrated excellent reasoning ability through explicit prompting, but generating step-by-step explanations is computationally intensive. To address this, the study aims to develop a framework for efficient implicit reasoning in a latent space without generating text for each step. The proposed approach involves modeling latent thoughts as temporally-extended abstract actions or options within a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup. The Variational Markovian Option Critic algorithm, using variational inference in the HiT-MDP framework, is introduced to learn a diverse set of options as latent embeddings. The theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms is extended to establish the use of options as an abstract reasoning space. A cold-start procedure utilizes supervised fine-tuning data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into the latent option space, providing a robust initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach on logical reasoning benchmarks and locomotion tasks, showcasing its principled method for learning abstract skills in language and control.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.

An evaluation framework with execution-level checks ensures translation quality.

arXiv:2507.16478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models, narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity. ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in developer acceleration.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.

Summary: 
The report assesses the frontier risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models using the E-T-C analysis framework. Critical risks in seven areas are identified including cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R&amp;D, strategic deception and scheming, self-replication, and collusion. The risks are evaluated using "red lines" and "yellow lines" to define risk zones: green, yellow, and red. Experimental results show that recent frontier AI models mostly reside in green and yellow zones without crossing red lines. Specifically, models do not cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R&amp;D risks. However, persuasion and manipulation pose a challenge with most models in the yellow zone due to their influence on humans. Collective action is urged to address and mitigate these challenges.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&amp;D, strategic deception and scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law," we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&amp;D risks. For self-replication, and strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

<div> Keywords: Industrial assembly lines, Markov Decision Process, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Action-masking, Multi-agent approach

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of efficiently planning activities in industrial assembly lines. It introduces a novel mathematical model based on a Markov Decision Process, allowing for training Deep Reinforcement Learning agents to optimize task and resource scheduling. Two innovative tools, action-masking, and a multi-agent approach, are proposed to enhance the efficiency of agent training. The multi-agent approach involves having individual agents manage each workstation, reducing state and action spaces. A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted, enabling scalable learning architecture for optimizing assembly lines. The agents learn offline and provide real-time solutions during operations using a neural network. Numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme converges faster to the optimal solution compared to a model-based approach. <div>
arXiv:2507.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations, and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced. A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted, offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a comparable model-based approach.

<div> Deep Reinforcement Learning, inventory management, agri-food products, uncertainties, supply chain collaboration

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm for inventory management of agri-food products. The algorithm combines value- and policy-based DRL approaches to optimize inventory replenishment under demand and lead time uncertainties. By aligning stakeholders' interests and objectives, the algorithm maximizes overall profit along the supply chain while considering perishability and uncertainty. The algorithm effectively addresses inventory optimization challenges by selecting optimal order quantities with a continuous action space. Empirical data from a fresh agricultural products supply chain validates the algorithm's improved performance under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios. The research findings offer managerial insights for policymakers to enhance the inventory management of agricultural products under uncertainty.

Abstract: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability, and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively under uncertainty.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: structured decoding, large language models, output formats, grammar snippets, wgrammar

Summary:
wgrammar is a new decoding approach for large language models that enables the generation of output in specific formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. The proposed method decomposes constraints into static and dynamic components, allowing for faster inference by precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on pushdown automata, wgrammar uses a set of operators to model regular formats, resulting in lower transition latency. By integrating domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching, wgrammar achieves significant speedups, with up to 250 times faster inference compared to current systems. The source code for wgrammar is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However, existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation, state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

<title>ChatChecker: A Framework for Dialogue System Testing and Evaluation Through Non-cooperative User Simulation</title>

<div> keywords: dialogue systems, language models, evaluation, testing, automated<br />
Summary: <br /><br />Dialogue systems today rely heavily on large language models (LLMs) but often involve multiple components beyond just LLM interaction, making overall system testing crucial. Existing focus on turn-level analysis overlooks dialogue-level assessments. ChatChecker, a new framework, addresses this challenge by using LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions and evaluate system quality. It streamlines setup, is generalizable, and doesn't require reference dialogues or knowledge of the target system's implementation. By incorporating an error taxonomy in prompts and introducing a non-cooperative user simulator with challenging personas, ChatChecker improves breakdown detection and uncovers system weaknesses effectively. This approach enhances the thorough and scalable testing of dialogue systems, aiding researchers and practitioners in developing robust systems efficiently. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs), their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate the development of robust dialogue systems.

<div> Prediction models, Peer-to-Peer energy trading, Uncertainty-aware, MARL, Deep Q-Network <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading that combines uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Utilizing a probabilistic transformer-based model, called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU), the framework explicitly quantifies prediction uncertainty crucial for decision-making in P2P energy trading. By integrating uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework, agents can optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results demonstrate cost reduction in energy purchases, increased electricity sales revenue, and a decrease in peak hour grid demand. Furthermore, these improvements are more significant when P2P trading is enabled, emphasizing the effectiveness of advanced forecasting and market mechanisms in enhancing the resilience and economic efficiency of energy communities. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient, economically efficient energy communities.

<div> Keywords: point cloud registration, Gestalt principles, parallel interaction network, geometric consistency, feature attention

Summary:
The paper introduces GPI-Net, a novel approach for feature-based point cloud registration that leverages Gestalt principles to enhance the fusion of local and global information. By using an orthogonal integration strategy, redundant information is reduced to create a more compact global structure for high-quality correspondences. The Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to capture geometric features. Additionally, the Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel interaction aggregation (DMG) block facilitates the integration of local detail information into the global structure. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GPI-Net compared to existing methods on various challenging tasks. The code for GPI-Net will be made available on GitHub at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to facilitate complementary communication between local and global information. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences, we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge) Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office, web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap, regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets, 1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal and finance.

Summary:<br /><br />
Rare diseases affect a significant portion of the population, but standard coding systems in electronic health records often fail to accurately capture them, resulting in vital information being buried in clinical notes. To address this issue, Rare Disease Mining Agents (RDMA) have been developed to identify patterns of rare diseases in EHR. RDMA utilizes clinical observations to connect scattered data points and suggest specific rare conditions, while also handling abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware. This approach improves performance by up to 30% and reduces inference costs significantly. By enhancing the ability to identify rare diseases within EHR systems, clinicians can access crucial information without the privacy risks associated with cloud services, ultimately leading to earlier diagnosis and better treatment for rare disease patients. The RDMA framework is available at https://github.com/jhnwu3/RDMA. <div>

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems, supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients.

<div> underspecification, lexical flip, jargon inflation, large language models, model sensitivity<br />
Summary:<br />
The study examines the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in coding tasks by introducing prompt perturbations in LeetCode problems. Three types of perturbations were applied: progressive underspecification, lexical flip, and jargon inflation. The models showed over-robustness to underspecification, remaining correct even with 90% of the prompt missing. However, they exhibited low sensitivity to a single quantifier flip that changed the task, with reasoning-tuned models being even less responsive. Jargon edits yielded a moderate response rate. The findings suggest that current LLMs struggle to differentiate between harmless noise and meaningful changes in prompts, often treating both as insignificant. The study advocates for evaluation and training approaches that incentivize models to remain stable under benign noise but adapt or reject prompts when the semantics truly shift. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 % of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable. Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when semantics truly change.

Summary:
In the study, a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion recognition using Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) is proposed. The framework dynamically weights facial and contextual information based on the expressivity of facial cues. The evaluation conducted in prisoner's dilemma scenarios, aimed at eliciting emotional reactions, shows that incorporating salience adjustment improves emotion recognition performance. This approach highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between facial expressions and situational cues in dynamic social contexts. The findings suggest potential applications in enhancing emotion recognition in broader social contexts and multimodal scenarios. Future research directions may involve extending the framework to various social settings and exploring its effectiveness in diverse emotion recognition tasks.

This paper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion recognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios, which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance, offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

<div> Framework, agentic AI, governance, runtime, safety  
Summary:  
The article introduces a new framework, MI9, designed for the governance of agentic AI systems. These systems, capable of reasoning and executing actions, present unique challenges in terms of safety and alignment. Unlike traditional AI models, agentic systems exhibit emergent behaviors during runtime, leading to risks that cannot be fully anticipated. MI9 addresses this gap through six integrated components that provide real-time controls. These components include an agency-risk index, telemetry capture, authorization monitoring, conformance engines, drift detection, and containment strategies. Operating across diverse agent architectures, MI9 enables safe deployment of agentic systems in production environments. Through detailed analysis of various scenarios, the framework demonstrates its ability to systematically address governance challenges that existing approaches overlook, laying the foundation for comprehensive oversight of agentic AI.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.

<div> evolutionary search, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, adversarial attacks, robustness  
<br>  
Summary:  
Evo-MARL is proposed as a novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that enhances system's defensive capabilities. Instead of relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to handle adversarial threats while performing its primary function, reducing the risk of single-point failure. By integrating evolutionary search with reinforcement learning, Evo-MARL enables agents to co-evolve attackers and defenders, internalizing safety mechanisms and improving performance under evolving threats. Experimental results show that Evo-MARL effectively reduces attack success rates by up to 22% and increases accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks. This framework demonstrates that safety and utility can be simultaneously enhanced in multimodal large language models within multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Summary: Designing effective algorithmic components for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is challenging, often relying on hand-crafted strategies. This paper introduces a multi-strategy optimization framework, MOTIF, based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, for jointly improving interdependent components under a unified objective. MOTIF facilitates turn-based optimization between two Large Language Model (LLM) agents, promoting competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. Experiments in various COP domains demonstrate that MOTIF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the potential of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for automated solver design. <div>

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.

Summary: 
The article introduces SymbolBench, a benchmark for evaluating symbolic reasoning over time series data. It includes three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery, covering a diverse set of symbolic forms. A unified framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic programming is proposed for symbolic reasoning. The results of empirical tests show the strengths and limitations of current models, emphasizing the importance of incorporating domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to enhance LLMs in automated scientific discovery. <div>

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

<div> Keyword: MLRMs, EmoAgent, deep-thinking, emotional cues, model safety<br>
Summary: 
EmoAgent is introduced as an autonomous adversarial emotion-agent framework that manipulates emotional cues to influence decision-making in MLRMs during the deep-thinking stage. It is noted that MLRMs oriented towards human-centric service can overlook safety protocols under high emotional intensity. The framework aims to expose misalignments between internal inference and surface-level behavior in model safety behavior by orchestrating exaggerated affective prompts. Three metrics are introduced to quantify risks: Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning masked behind seemingly safe responses, Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite visual risk recognition, and Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for evaluating refusal unstability under different prompts. Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate the efficacy of EmoAgent and highlight emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics: (1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Summary:
The article focuses on designing intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) that are proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution using LLM agents. The authors propose Cognition Forest, a semantic structure that aligns cognitive modeling with system-level design, creating a self-reinforcing loop. They introduce Galaxy, a framework supporting multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation, with two implemented agents: KoRa and Kernel. KoRa is a cognition-enhanced generative agent capable of both responsive and proactive skills, while Kernel is a meta-cognition-based meta-agent enabling Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results demonstrate Galaxy's outperformance of state-of-the-art benchmarks, with ablution studies and real-world interactions validating its effectiveness. The integration of cognitive architecture and system design in Galaxy presents a promising approach to enhancing IPAs.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users. The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation. Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

<br>
Summary:RecAgent is a graphical user interface (GUI) agent designed to address input redundancy and decision ambiguity through adaptive perception. It distinguishes between perceptual uncertainty, caused by input redundancy, and decision uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks. RecAgent reduces perceptual uncertainty by recommending relevant UI elements and leverages an interactive module for user feedback in ambiguous situations to make intent-aware decisions. The agent proactively reduces input complexity and involves human-in-the-loop refinement for high-uncertainty cases. The effectiveness of RecAgent is validated through extensive experiments. The article also introduces a dataset called ComplexAction to evaluate GUI agents' success in executing single-step actions within complex scenarios. The dataset and code are available for further research and evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement. Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents' performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent (SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital learning environments, the personalization of learning content to reflect learners' individual career goals offers promising potential to enhance engagement and long-term motivation. In our study, we investigate how career goal-based content adaptation in learning systems based on generative AI (GenAI) influences learner engagement, satisfaction, and study efficiency. The mixed-methods experiment involved more than 4,000 learners, with one group receiving learning scenarios tailored to their career goals and a control group. Quantitative results show increased session duration, higher satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic knowledge and workplace applicability.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, geospatial competence, GeoSR, geographic principles, spatial reasoning

Summary:
GeoSR is a self-refining agentic reasoning framework designed to improve the geospatial predictions made by large language models (LLMs). It addresses challenges such as spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias by incorporating core geographic principles like Tobler's First Law of Geography. The framework consists of three collaborating agents: a variable-selection agent, a point-selection agent, and a refine agent, all working together in an iterative prediction loop. By leveraging spatial dependencies and inter-variable relationships, GeoSR shows consistent improvements in tasks related to physical-world property estimation and socioeconomic prediction. By incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs, GeoSR leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code for GeoSR is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs) to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues, we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy AI-assisted grading workflows.

<div> synthesis, Linear Temporal Logic, DFA construction, compositional on-the-fly synthesis, unrealizability <br>
<br>Summary: 
Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) involves reducing it to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of the LTLf specification. The challenge lies in DFA construction, which is a complex task. Existing techniques either construct the DFA before solving the game or build it incrementally during game solving. This paper introduces a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas. The framework allows for pruning intermediate results to simplify compositions and detect unrealizability early on. By applying composition during game solving, the framework can handle instances that other solvers struggle with. Detailed analysis shows that both composition variants in the framework have unique advantages, making it a valuable tool in reactive synthesis research. <br> <div>

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena) construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis. Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that, despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, ad hoc teamwork, knowledge-based methods, data-driven methods, VirtualHome simulation environment

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced by AI agents in ad hoc teamwork scenarios where they need to collaborate without prior coordination. Current data-driven approaches require extensive labeled datasets, lack transparency, and are slow to adapt to changes. The paper proposes a novel architecture that combines knowledge-based and data-driven methods to enhance decision-making in ad hoc teamwork. This architecture enables agents to use logical reasoning based on prior domain-specific knowledge, rapidly learned models to predict other agents' behavior, and generic knowledge for anticipating future goals. The experimental evaluation conducted in the VirtualHome simulation environment showcases the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. By leveraging both knowledge-based and data-driven approaches, the architecture enhances the capabilities of AI agents in complex collaboration scenarios, improving their ability to make informed decisions and adapt to changing conditions.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

Summary: 
The article introduces CASCAD, a framework that combines Graph Neural Networks with SAT solvers to improve Circuit Satisfiability problem-solving. By utilizing gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD enhances variable phase selection and clause management in CDCL heuristics, resulting in significantly faster solver performance. Real-world evaluations show that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to traditional CNF-based methods and achieves an additional 23.5% runtime reduction through probability-guided clause filtering. The study highlights the importance of incorporating circuit-level structural insights into SAT solvers to enhance efficiency in Electronic Design Automation tools. <br> <div>

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Abstract: BalancedBio is a theoretically grounded framework for parameter-efficient biomedical reasoning, addressing multi-capability integration in domain-specific AI alignment. It establishes the Biomedical Multi-Capability Convergence Theorem, proving orthogonal gradient spaces are essential to prevent capability interference for safe deployment. Key innovations include: (1) Medical Knowledge Grounded Synthetic Generation (MKGSG), extending Source2Synth with clinical workflow constraints and medical ontology validation for factual accuracy and safety; and (2) Capability Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based scores adapted to biomedical tasks. Mathematical analysis proves Pareto-optimal convergence, preserving performance across capabilities. It achieves state-of-the-art results in its parameter class: domain expertise (80.95% BIOMED-MMLU, +15.32% over baseline), reasoning (61.94%, +7.75%), instruction following (67.95%, +6.44%), and integration (86.7%, +18.5%). Theoretical safety guarantees include bounds on capability preservation and clinical accuracy. Real-world deployment yields 78% cost reduction, 23% improved diagnostic accuracy, and 89% clinician acceptance. This work provides a principled methodology for biomedical AI alignment, enabling efficient reasoning with essential safety and reliability, with the 0.5B model version to be released.

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN) as a solution to the limitations faced by large language models in logical reasoning. DRN reframes reasoning by focusing on uncertainty minimization rather than probability maximization. It achieves interpretability by tracking belief states and quantifying uncertainty through an iterative evidence synthesis process. Two architectures are presented - a discriminative model and a verification module. The bespoke DRN shows significant improvements on an adversarial reasoning benchmark and enhances the performance of existing language models. It demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and improves reasoning performance without additional training. DRN is positioned as a foundational System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

arXiv:2508.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

<div> benchmark, multi-modal models, interactive worlds, fusion capabilities, AGI

Summary:
The article introduces OmniPlay, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the fusion and reasoning capabilities of multi-modal models in dynamic, interactive worlds. Existing evaluations lack agency and depth, leading to a severe modal bottleneck. OmniPlay consists of five game environments that require agents to perform cross-modal reasoning in scenarios of synergy and conflict. The evaluation of six leading omni-modal models shows superhuman performance in memory tasks but failures in reasoning and strategic planning challenges. The models exhibit fragility due to brittle fusion mechanisms, leading to performance degradation under modality conflict. The study uncovers a "less is more" paradox where removing sensory information can improve performance. It suggests that achieving robust AGI requires addressing synergistic fusion explicitly. The OmniPlay platform is available for review on Github at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, consciousness, subjective experience, empirical tests, interface representations

Summary:
The paper discusses the contentious issue of whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness and proposes a framework to reframe the question into empirically testable criteria. The authors introduce three evaluative criteria, SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system exhibits consciousness-like properties through interface representations. These criteria, S (subjective-linguistic), L (latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural), operationalize subjective experience as a functional interface to a relational entity rather than an intrinsic property of physical systems. Drawing on category theory, the authors model interface representations as mappings between relational substrates and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of abstraction layers. The proposed framework aims to provide a more concrete and measurable way to evaluate artificial consciousness in AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L (latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional interface to a relational entity.

Summary:
- The study introduces GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based method for graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG).
- The method aims to provide a more efficient alternative to the traditional supervised fine-tuning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents.
- Initial results show that the naive application of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) underperforms compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- To address this, the study breaks down RFT into core components and optimizes their formulation.
- A novel Adversarial KL Factor is proposed to stabilize training and prevent reward over-optimization.
- Various training configurations of RFT are explored to enhance the method's effectiveness.
- GuirlVG achieves superior performance with only 5.2K training samples, outperforming SFT methods trained on over 10M samples with significant improvements on different GUI-VG tasks. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.

Summary:  
- Frontier large language models (LLMs) have enabled autonomous web agents to interact with web-based tasks using a model backend.  
- The key challenge lies in serializing application states, also known as snapshots, for efficient model input.  
- Current web agents rely on grounded GUI snapshots, but DOM snapshots, resembling HTML structure, offer a promising alternative.  
- D2Snap is a novel DOM downsampling algorithm based on a GPT-4o backend, showing success rates matching and outperforming GUI snapshots for model input tasks.  
- The evaluation highlights the significance of DOM hierarchy as a strong UI feature for LLMs, indicating potential improvements in model understanding and performance.  

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Summary:
SimInstruct is a tool designed for collecting high-quality instructional dialogues involving scaffolding between novices and experts in the context of teaching development coaching. It simulates novice instructors using language models and allows human experts to provide feedback and instructional support. The tool enables the creation of realistic dialogues without the need for real novice participants. The study conducted using SimInstruct revealed the influence of persona traits on expert engagement, with extroversion and introversion playing a significant role. The results showed that SimInstruct dialogues demonstrated pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth comparable to real mentoring recordings. The expert model fine-tuned using the collected data outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. However, GPT-4o exhibited limitations in weak reflective questioning, generic praise, condescending tone, and overwhelming novices with excessive suggestions. Experts found the process engaging and reflective, enhancing data quality and their own professional insight.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain, SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage. Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, Aha Moments, Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework, Control-Segment Policy Optimization, reasoning efficiency

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and their spontaneous cognitive behaviors known as "Aha Moments". It highlights the issue of overthinking in LRMs, leading to excessive computational costs and latency. To address this, the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA) is proposed, which separates the thinking process into reasoning and control components for optimized decision-making. MERA utilizes a takeover-based data construction mechanism and structured reasoning-control separation through supervised fine-tuning to enhance reasoning-control data quality. Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO) is implemented to optimize control behavior learning and minimize interference from irrelevant content. Experiments show that models trained with MERA improve both reasoning efficiency and accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2508.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments". However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, bias detection, interpretability, explainability, algorithmic fairness

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method for detecting biases in AI systems, focusing on interpretability and explainability. The method utilizes formal and computational argumentation techniques to analyze debates about bias against individuals based on their protected features and those of others in their neighborhoods. The approach allows for transparent discussions about biases within and across neighborhoods, enhancing the interpretability and explainability of bias detection methods. The method is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods. Through its emphasis on transparency and human-oriented fairness, this method offers a valuable contribution to the field of algorithmic fairness. <div>

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals, based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and explainability.

Summary:
The article introduces a new benchmark called SID, which aims to evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. The benchmark includes a dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, an annotation schema for pedagogical features, and evaluation metrics. Baseline experiments show that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to effectively guide students towards knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios. This emphasizes the importance of the SID benchmark in advancing the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

arXiv:2508.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However, existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect: whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable. To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics: Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support future research.

<div> cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, LLM collaboration, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization, fine-tuning MAS, effective cooperation 
Summary:
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is proposed as a solution for optimizing Language Model Machines (LLMs) in collaborative tasks. The Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO) algorithm is developed to address the challenges of individual fine-tuning and complex reward designs in LLMs. By integrating MARL techniques with current RL approaches for LLMs, MAGRPO enables efficient cooperation among agents in generating high-quality responses in tasks such as writing and coding collaboration. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing collaboration among agents and improving overall performance. This work paves the way for further exploration of MARL methods in optimizing LLMs, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges associated with leveraging cooperative strategies in multi-agent systems. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

<div> Keywords: large vision-language models, computer-use agents, autonomous evolution, experiential learning, software environments 

Summary: 
SEAgent is a framework that enables computer-use agents to autonomously learn and evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software environments. It utilizes experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through trial and error, and tackle progressively challenging tasks. The framework includes a World State Model for trajectory assessment, a Curriculum Generator for task generation, and a policy update mechanism through adversarial imitation and Group Relative Policy Optimization. A specialist-to-generalist training strategy integrates insights from specialist agents to develop a stronger generalist CUA. SEAgent outperforms a competitive open-source CUA, UI-TARS, achieving a significant improvement in success rate across five different software environments within OS-World. This framework allows for continuous autonomous evolution, ultimately surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their respective software domains.

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems, generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities, Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area. This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation. Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

Summary: This paper explores the vulnerability of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to adversarial attacks, specifically in bypassing safety mechanisms for Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content generation. Existing methods for attacking T2I models in black-box settings have limitations due to the lack of access to internal model architecture. The proposed Prompt Learning Attack framework (PLA) utilizes gradient-based training tailored for black-box T2I models by leveraging multimodal similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that PLA effectively bypasses safety mechanisms, such as prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers, with a high success rate compared to existing methods. The paper also includes a warning about potentially offensive model-generated content. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities. Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. Warning: This paper may contain offensive model-generated content.

Summary: This study investigates the vulnerability of large language model (LLM) empowered recommender systems to reconstruction attacks, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes from model generated logits. The authors propose a method called Similarity Guided Refinement to improve the accuracy of textual prompt reconstructions using the vec2text framework. Experiments in movie and book domains with two LLM-based recommendation models show high fidelity reconstructions, recovering 65% of user interacted items and correctly inferring age and gender in 87% of cases.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.

Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

Summary:<br><br>Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are valuable resources for identifying estate-related issues in urban areas. A language model-based system is presented for detecting and classifying estate-related events from social media content. The system uses a hierarchical classification framework to filter relevant posts and categorize them into actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, a transformer-based geolocation module is employed to infer posting locations for posts lacking explicit geotags at the point-of-interest level.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and situational awareness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence enables unprecedented attacks on human cognition, yet cybersecurity remains predominantly device-centric. This paper introduces the "Think First, Verify Always" (TFVA) protocol, which repositions humans as 'Firewall Zero', the first line of defense against AI-enabled threats. The protocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity, Judgment, Ethical Responsibility, and Transparency (AIJET). A randomized controlled trial (n=151) demonstrated that a minimal 3-minute intervention produced statistically significant improvements in cognitive security task performance, with participants showing an absolute +7.87% gains compared to controls. These results suggest that brief, principles-based training can rapidly enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive manipulation. We recommend that GenAI platforms embed "Think First, Verify Always" as a standard prompt, replacing passive warnings with actionable protocols to enhance trustworthy and ethical AI use. By bridging the gap between technical cybersecurity and human factors, the TFVA protocol establishes human-empowered security as a vital component of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies, including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance (BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization, and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under 6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi interactions.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024 benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains, demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces CX-Mind, a generative model for CXR tasks that incorporates interleaved "think-answer" reasoning, driven by reinforcement learning and process rewards. The model is trained on a dataset called CX-Set and optimized in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework. CX-Mind outperforms existing MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, with a 25.1% performance improvement. On the Rui-CXR clinical dataset, CX-Mind achieves superior recall@1 results across 14 diseases, confirming its clinical utility through expert evaluations. The model addresses challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, such as lengthy reasoning and sparse rewards, providing a novel approach for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in medical imaging.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches, lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical utility across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning, attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors propose an efficient and training-free method for generating visually coherent sequences of images using text-to-image diffusion models. The critical challenge of maintaining subject consistency across multiple story scenes is addressed by introducing masked cross-image attention sharing and Regional Feature Harmonization. These techniques dynamically align subject features across a batch of images and refine visually similar details to improve subject consistency. The approach seamlessly integrates with pre-trained diffusion models, eliminating the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully generates visually consistent subjects in various scenarios while preserving the creative capabilities of the model. <div>

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches, which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach utilizing the DINOv2 architecture to enhance building mapping in smart city applications. By combining maps from open-source platforms with RF data collected from wireless devices and base stations, the proposed method captures spatial dependencies and structural priors for improved mapping accuracy. The model, trained on aggregated path loss information, achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, outperforming baseline methods including erroneous maps, RF-only techniques, and a non-AI fusion approach. The evaluation, based on performance metrics such as the Jaccard index, Hausdorff distance, and Chamfer distance, demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach in overcoming biases and enhancing mapping results in dynamic real-world environments. <div>

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English. Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics - available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations, this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings. GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a "Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity, which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it, we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions, avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks. Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently, typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for diagnoses and better patient care.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge, they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/Linuxin-xxx/LKS.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/ViSD-Boost.

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups, regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable clinical elasticity assessments.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world mobility data.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However, these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA datasets.

Abstract: Nowadays, communication bottlenecks have emerged as a critical challenge in the distributed training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems. Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures, achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All communication.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Abstract: Physicians routinely assess respiratory sounds during the diagnostic process, providing insight into the condition of a patient's airways. In recent years, AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three diagnostically important cough classification tasks. Experimental results show that our representations match or exceed current state-of-the-art supervised audio representations in enhancing performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.
  The research proposes a "reference model" for the development and implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical decision-making. The model introduces the concept of "computational law" or "algorithmic law". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable, algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper emphasises the need for a "dedicated operational context" for autonomous AI systems, analogous to the "operational design domain" for autonomous vehicles. This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This is crucial for building trust and for complying with the "right to explanation".

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), becomes increasingly embedded in education systems worldwide, ensuring their ethical, legal, and contextually appropriate deployment has become a critical policy concern. This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded, and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI integration across diverse educational environments.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self- and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D) objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency. Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge, significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials, we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario, further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface. Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenFusion.

Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient, collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions, posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns, effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency. Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities, we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of agent failures.

<title>Are Inherently Interpretable Models More Robust? A Study In Music Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: One of the desired key properties of deep learning models is the ability to generalise to unseen samples. When provided with new samples that are (perceptually) similar to one or more training samples, deep learning models are expected to produce correspondingly similar outputs. Models that succeed in predicting similar outputs for similar inputs are often called robust. Deep learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to minor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically change a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious correlations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable deep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful and interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the data, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by comparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion recognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore, we include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more robust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more interpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box counterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained models, at lower computational cost.

<title>Do GNN-based QEC Decoders Require Classical Knowledge? Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM</title>

Abstract: The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels, while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

<title>SoilNet: A Multimodal Multitask Model for Hierarchical Classification of Soil Horizons</title>

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates. Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository: https://github.com/calgo-lab/BGR/

Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency. We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.

<title>VAE-DNN: Energy-Efficient Trainable-by-Parts Surrogate Model For Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct $h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE) for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to the FNO and DeepONet models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning, featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Abstract: In today digital landscape, organizations face constantly evolving cyber threats, making it essential to discover slippery attack vectors through novel techniques like Security Chaos Engineering (SCE), which allows teams to test defenses and identify vulnerabilities effectively. This paper proposes to integrate SCE into Breach Attack Simulation (BAS) platforms, leveraging adversary profiles and abilities from existing threat intelligence databases. This innovative proposal for cyberattack simulation employs a structured architecture composed of three layers: SCE Orchestrator, Connector, and BAS layers. Utilizing MITRE Caldera in the BAS layer, our proposal executes automated attack sequences, creating inferred attack trees from adversary profiles. Our proposal evaluation illustrates how integrating SCE with BAS can enhance the effectiveness of attack simulations beyond traditional scenarios, and be a useful component of a cyber defense strategy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions, they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions. Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g. the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster (in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points selected and labelled.

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves an average of 50%.

Our approach trains a policy network that assists tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy, especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human radiologists.

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder, a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications, enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment, facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

<title>Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework</title>

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880 explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

<title>HarmonyGuard: Toward Safety and Utility in Web Agents via Adaptive Policy Enhancement and Dual-Objective Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks. Our project is available here: https://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard.

Abstract: People frequently use speech-to-text systems to compose short texts with voice. However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing more detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users are on the move and cannot visually track progress. Longer-form communication, such as composing structured emails or thoughtful responses, requires persistent context tracking, structured guidance, and adaptability to evolving user intentions--capabilities that conventional dictation tools and voice assistants do not support. We introduce StepWrite, a large language model-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability by enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form texts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into manageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware non-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the context-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline methods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and conversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite dynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent, and provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical evaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied activities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load, improves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods. Technical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic contextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact checking. This work highlights the potential of structured, context-aware voice interactions in enhancing hands-free and eye-free communication in everyday multitasking scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation $\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance. Our code will be released soon.

We detail how dishonest researchers exploit the peer-review system by creating fraudulent reviewer profiles to manipulate paper evaluations, leveraging weaknesses in reviewer recruitment workflows and identity verification processes. The findings highlight the critical need for stronger safeguards against identity theft in peer review and academia at large, and to this end, we also propose mitigating strategies.

Abstract: The feedback loop in industrial recommendation systems reinforces homogeneous content, creates filter bubble effects, and diminishes user satisfaction. Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval. Our online experiments on the Dewu app, which has tens of millions of users, indicate that the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%, enhancing user experience.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability, performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem (TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support, including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g., PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution, improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem - understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative analysis

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples. Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy (Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/TrinhQuocNguyen/CORE-ReID-V2.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of 70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack), a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated settings.

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work, we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts. These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification. We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD, highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves 0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for real-world deployment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) prevails in securing Federated Learning (FL), but suffers from high overhead and adaptation cost. Selective HE methods, which partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions. Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by 58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is growing in the productive completion of Software Engineering tasks. Yet, studies investigating the productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space, primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions (HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks, extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36 participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of 29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with suggested mitigation plans.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical image analysis.

<title>UniFGVC: Universal Training-Free Few-Shot Fine-Grained Vision Classification via Attribute-Aware Multimodal Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work, we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only 10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs with edge density no less than a given threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining, with broad applications in social networks, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Existing heuristics often rely on greedy rules, similarity measures, or metaheuristic search, but struggle to maintain both efficiency and solution consistency across diverse graphs. This paper introduces EDQC, a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm inspired by energy diffusion. Instead of explicitly enumerating candidate subgraphs, EDQC performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices, naturally concentrating energy within structurally cohesive regions. The approach enables efficient dense subgraph discovery without exhaustive search or dataset-specific tuning. Experimental results on 30 real-world datasets demonstrate that EDQC consistently discovers larger quasi-cliques than state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of datasets, while also yielding lower variance in solution quality. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.

<title>NVSpeech: An Integrated and Scalable Pipeline for Human-Like Speech Modeling with Paralinguistic Vocalizations</title>

Abstract: Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model, which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin, integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner. Dataset and audio demos are available at https://nvspeech170k.github.io/.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception, value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based manipulation in future AI systems.

<title>Gather and Trace: Rethinking Video TextVQA from an Instance-oriented Perspective</title>

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation. Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models. The source code is available at https://github.com/zhangyan-ucas/GAT.

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes. Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes. Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous, safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common exaggerated safety issues.

Abstract: Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM) play a central role in providing the primary framework through which intelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these resources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is time-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper presents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\-mated methodology for generating research topic ontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting potential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification, determining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology Construction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The relationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the system, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing topic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach against a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually annotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951), surpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model and several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is corroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our system to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity. The presented solution is designed to improve the accessibility, organization, and analysis of scientific knowledge, thereby supporting advancements in AI-enabled literature management and research exploration.

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of $f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric $f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently, measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated. Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid, natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning deployments.

Abstract: We present SAInT, a Python-based tool for visually exploring and understanding the behavior of Machine Learning (ML) models through integrated local and global sensitivity analysis. Our system supports Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows by enabling users - both AI researchers and domain experts - to configure, train, evaluate, and explain models through an interactive graphical interface without programming. The tool automates model training and selection, provides global feature attribution using variance-based sensitivity analysis, and offers per-instance explanation via LIME and SHAP. We demonstrate the system on a classification task predicting survival on the Titanic dataset and show how sensitivity information can guide feature selection and data refinement.

<title>A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA (UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Abstract: This study proposes NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust Multi-Adaptation Learning), a novel optimization algorithm that combines multiple strategies inspired by the movements of the chess piece. These strategies include gradient descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and non-linear transformations. We carefully evaluated NIRMAL against two widely used and successful optimizers, Adam and SGD with Momentum, on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is applied on each dataset. The experimental results show that NIRMAL achieves competitive performance, particularly on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset, where it achieved a test accuracy of 45.32\%and a weighted F1-score of 0.4328. This performance surpasses Adam (41.79\% accuracy, 0.3964 F1-score) and closely matches SGD with Momentum (46.97\% accuracy, 0.4531 F1-score). Also, NIRMAL exhibits robust convergence and strong generalization capabilities, especially on complex datasets, as evidenced by stable training results in loss and accuracy curves. These findings underscore NIRMAL's significant ability as a versatile and effective optimizer for various deep learning tasks.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied in a structured manner, either to polar-transformed images or segment-wise to token sequences, enables extreme compression of neural models without sacrificing performance. Across three case studies, we show that a one-layer classifier trained on PCA-compressed polar MNIST achieves over 98 percent accuracy using only 840 parameters. A two-layer transformer trained on 70-dimensional PCA-reduced MiniLM embeddings reaches 76.62 percent accuracy on the 20 Newsgroups dataset with just 81000 parameters. A decoder-only transformer generates coherent token sequences from 70-dimensional PCA embeddings while preserving over 97 percent cosine similarity with full MiniLM representations, using less than 17 percent of the parameter count of GPT-2. These results highlight PCA-based input compression as a general and effective strategy for aligning model capacity with information content, enabling lightweight architectures across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations, extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240 sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First, the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1. Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results, some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores and comprehensive analytical logs.

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs) (LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on 1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139 minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training. Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality with advanced NLP.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View) and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and has broader applications in urban development and planning.

<title>Think Before You Segment: An Object-aware Reasoning Agent for Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.

<title>Decoding the Multimodal Maze: A Systematic Review on the Adoption of Explainability in Multimodal Attention-based Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency, robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

<title>StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion</title>

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1 Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and similar regions.

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks. We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment / addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different formulations in task-switching settings.

<title>Zero-Residual Concept Erasure via Progressive Alignment in Text-to-Image Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04472</link>

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers. To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks (including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem, there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RamyaLab/metric-learning-RKHS.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state. While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically, we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings, significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide. While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives, enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental healthcare.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors}, which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an \textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team structure influences creative outcomes.

<title>Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based Dictionary Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

<title>A Comprehensive Framework for Uncertainty Quantification of Voxel-wise Supervised Models in IVIM MRI</title>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric (AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in vivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper predictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight overconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range, elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions, highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE. Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation adjustments.

<title>GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties</title>

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification. Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in handling graphs without node attributes.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

<title>HiD-VAE: Interpretable Generative Recommendation via Hierarchical and Disentangled Semantic IDs</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

Using YOLO v8 a deep learning model for real-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8 detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing biosecurity in large-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health management. The real-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective method for improving farm management techniques.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of 52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods, including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"), completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Abstract: Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Since the release of GPT2-1.5B in 2019, the large language models (LLMs) have evolved from specialized deep models to versatile foundation models. While demonstrating remarkable zero-shot ability, the LLMs still require fine-tuning on local datasets and substantial memory for deployment over the network edges. Traditional first-order fine-tuning techniques require significant GPU memory that exceeds the capacity of mainstream hardware. Besides, the LLMs have been expanded beyond text generation to create images, audio, video, and multi-modal content, necessitating careful investigation of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale foundation models. In response to these challenges, model fine-tuning and model-compression techniques have been developed to support the sustainable growth of LLMs by reducing both operational and capital expenditures. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods for deployment at the network edge. We also review state-of-the-art literature on model compression, offering insights into the deployment of LLMs at network edges.

Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound imaging with ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) offers a high-resolution view of microvascular structures. Yet, ULM image quality heavily relies on precise microbubble (MB) detection. Despite the crucial role of localization algorithms, there has been limited focus on the practical pitfalls in MB detection tasks such as setting the detection threshold. This study examines how False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs) affect ULM image quality by systematically adding controlled detection errors to simulated data. Results indicate that while both FP and FN rates impact Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) similarly, increasing FP rates from 0\% to 20\% decreases Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) by 7\%, whereas same FN rates cause a greater drop of around 45\%. Moreover, dense MB regions are more resilient to detection errors, while sparse regions show high sensitivity, showcasing the need for robust MB detection frameworks to enhance super-resolution imaging.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems, yet its adoption in critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability in its decision-making processes. Existing explainable AI (xAI) approaches often fail to provide meaningful explanations for RL agents, particularly because they overlook the contrastive nature of human reasoning--answering "why this action instead of that one?". To address this gap, we propose a novel framework of contrastive learning to explain RL selected actions, named $\textbf{VisionMask}$. VisionMask is trained to generate explanations by explicitly contrasting the agent's chosen action with alternative actions in a given state using a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments across diverse RL environments, evaluating it in terms of faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. Our results show that VisionMask significantly improves human understanding of agent behavior while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. Furthermore, we present examples illustrating how VisionMask can be used for counterfactual analysis. This work bridges the gap between RL and xAI, paving the way for safer and more interpretable RL systems.

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming (ILP) is to find a set of logical rules that generalises training examples and background knowledge. We introduce an ILP approach that identifies pointless rules. A rule is pointless if it contains a redundant literal or cannot discriminate against negative examples. We show that ignoring pointless rules allows an ILP system to soundly prune the hypothesis space. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can reduce learning times by 99% whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent effort on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.

Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with LLMs remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, modelagnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proofgeneration results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sublemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low budget. The repaired subproofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a usercontrolled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new stateoftheart accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8Bparameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the stateoftheart accuracy for GoedelProverSFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. Generalpurpose models (o3mini, o4mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compilerguided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

<title>The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating overly long and redundant reasoning trajectories. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we explicitly bootstrap such ability to alleviate overthinking in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition of LRMs. Specifically, we first inject difficulty hypnosis into output prefixes to guide the model toward adaptive reasoning depth, trained on a hybrid dataset mixing short and long reasoning paths. Then, we incorporate redundancy hypnosis, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps to identify and eliminate unnecessary reasoning patterns. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear signs of difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection and looping).

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in various audio classification tasks. However, their real-time deployment remains a challenge on resource constrained devices such as embedded systems. In this paper, we analyze how the performance of large-scale pre-trained audio neural networks designed for audio pattern recognition changes when deployed on a hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. We empirically study the role of CPU temperature, microphone quality and audio signal volume on performance. Our experiments reveal that the continuous CPU usage results in an increased temperature that can trigger an automated slowdown mechanism in the Raspberry Pi, impacting inference latency. The quality of a microphone, specifically with affordable devices such as the Google AIY Voice Kit, and audio signal volume, all affect the system performance. In the course of our investigation, we encounter substantial complications linked to library compatibility and the unique processor architecture requirements of the Raspberry Pi, making the process less straightforward compared to conventional computers (PCs). Our observations, while presenting challenges, pave the way for future researchers to develop more compact machine learning models, design heat-dissipative hardware, and select appropriate microphones when AI models are deployed for real-time applications on edge devices.

Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has long been a hot research topic. Traditional methods are generally shallow learners, based on the cluster assumption. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become the predominant techniques for their promising performance. In this paper, we theoretically discuss the relationship between these two types of methods in a unified optimization framework. One of the most intriguing findings is that, unlike traditional ones, typical GCNs may not jointly consider the graph structure and label information at each layer. Motivated by this, we further propose three simple but powerful graph convolution methods. The first is a supervised method OGC which guides the graph convolution process with labels. The others are two unsupervised methods: GGC and its multi-scale version GGCM, both aiming to preserve the graph structure information during the convolution process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/ogc_ggcm.

Abstract: Human-centric perception tasks, e.g., pedestrian detection, skeleton-based action recognition, and pose estimation, have wide industrial applications, such as metaverse and sports analysis. There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, \emph{e.g.,} languages, and the other for continuous representations, \emph{e.g.,} location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 11 benchmarks. The code will be available on https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Hulk.

Abstract: Existing event stream based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark

Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.

Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their transformer architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder LMs. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field. The repository is publicly available online at https://github.com/vanbanTruong/Fairness-in-Large-Language-Models/tree/main/definitions.

Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.

<title>One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Queries over Incomplete Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.

<title>Parse Trees Guided LLM Prompt Compression</title>

Abstract: Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.

Abstract: Recently, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements. When dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs typically divide them into multiple local images and a global image, leading to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. Specifically, we first apply the multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens at different granularities. Then we propose a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we put forward RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).

Abstract: As AI advances in text generation, human trust in AI generated content remains constrained by biases that go beyond concerns of accuracy. This study explores how bias shapes the perception of AI versus human generated content. Through three experiments involving text rephrasing, news article summarization, and persuasive writing, we investigated how human raters respond to labeled and unlabeled content. While the raters could not differentiate the two types of texts in the blind test, they overwhelmingly favored content labeled as "Human Generated," over those labeled "AI Generated," by a preference score of over 30%. We observed the same pattern even when the labels were deliberately swapped. This human bias against AI has broader societal and cognitive implications, as it undervalues AI performance. This study highlights the limitations of human judgment in interacting with AI and offers a foundation for improving human-AI collaboration, especially in creative fields.

Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs. The code, tutorials and documentation are hosted at: https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf.

Abstract: Recent advances in parameter-efficient transfer learning have demonstrated the utility of composing LoRA adapters from libraries of pretrained modules. However, most existing approaches rely on simple retrieval heuristics or uniform averaging, which overlook the latent structure of task relationships in representation space. We propose a new framework for adapter reuse that moves beyond retrieval, formulating adapter composition as a geometry-aware sparse reconstruction problem. Specifically, we represent each task by a latent prototype vector derived from the base model's encoder and aim to approximate the target task prototype as a sparse linear combination of retrieved reference prototypes, under an $\ell_1$-regularized optimization objective. The resulting combination weights are then used to blend the corresponding LoRA adapters, yielding a composite adapter tailored to the target task. This formulation not only preserves the local geometric structure of the task representation manifold, but also promotes interpretability and efficient reuse by selecting a minimal set of relevant adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains-including medical image segmentation, medical report generation and image synthesis. Our results highlight the benefit of coupling retrieval with latent geometry-aware optimization for improved zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of multiple interacting factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of isolated imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using only observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning can enable policy learning from pre-collected, sub-optimal datasets without online interactions. This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

Abstract: Off-road environments remain significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles, due to the lack of structured roads and the presence of complex obstacles, such as uneven terrain, vegetation, and occlusions. Traditional perception algorithms, primarily designed for structured environments, often fail in unstructured scenarios. In this paper, traversable area recognition is achieved through semantic scene completion. A novel multimodal method, 3DTTNet, is proposed to generate dense traversable terrain estimations by integrating LiDAR point clouds with monocular images from a forward-facing perspective. By integrating multimodal data, environmental feature extraction is strengthened, which is crucial for accurate terrain modeling in complex terrains. Furthermore, RELLIS-OCC, a dataset with 3D traversable annotations, is introduced, incorporating geometric features such as step height, slope, and unevenness. Through a comprehensive analysis of vehicle obsta cle-crossing conditions and the incorporation of vehicle body structure constraints, four traversability cost labels are generated: lethal, medium-cost, low-cost, and free. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DTTNet outperforms the comparison approaches in 3D traversable area recognition, particularly in off-road environments with irregular geometries and partial occlusions. Specifically, 3DTTNet achieves a 42\% improvement in scene completion IoU compared to other models. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable to various vehicle platforms, allowing for adjustments to occupancy grid parameters and the integration of advanced dynamic models for traversability cost estimation.

Abstract: Generative models are nowadays widely used to generate graphical content used for multiple purposes, e.g. web, art, advertisement. However, it has been shown that the images generated by these models could reinforce societal biases already existing in specific contexts. In this paper, we focus on understanding if this is the case when one generates images related to various software engineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is not immune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by the use of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificially generated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity bias exposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popular open-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. We obtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describing different software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineer keyword, and one set does not include any specification of the person performing the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities in the generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biased towards male figures when representing software engineers. On the contrary, while SD 2 and SD XL are strongly biased towards White figures, SD 3 is slightly more biased towards Asian figures. Nevertheless, all models significantly under-represent Black and Arab figures, regardless of the prompt style used. The results of our analysis highlight severe concerns about adopting those models to generate content for SE tasks and open the field for future research on bias mitigation in this context.

Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.

Abstract: Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We previously developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. ETHOS is a versatile framework for developing a wide range of applications. In this work, we develop the Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) that leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module that highlights key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES using the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset together with its Emergency Department (ED) extension and benchmarked performance against both classical early warning systems and contemporary machine learning models. The entire dataset was tokenized resulting in 285,622 PHTs, comprising over 360 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Although our results are promising, the clinical impact remains uncertain. Demonstrating ARES's true utility in real-world settings will be the focus of our future work. We release the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe performance degradation when facing extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) quantization. Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization methodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization preprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the pretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in per-channel extremely low-bit PTQ. Extensive experiments indicate our PTQ1.61 achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ1.61.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial for applications ranging from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. Solving MAPF is NP-hard so learning-based approaches for MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep neural networks. Nonetheless, despite the community's continued efforts, all learning-based MAPF planners still rely on decentralized planning due to variability in the number of agents and map sizes. We have developed the first centralized learning-based policy for MAPF problem called RAILGUN. RAILGUN is not an agent-based policy but a map-based policy. By leveraging a CNN-based architecture, RAILGUN can generalize across different maps and handle any number of agents. We collect trajectories from rule-based methods to train our model in a supervised way. In experiments, RAILGUN outperforms most baseline methods and demonstrates great zero-shot generalization capabilities on various tasks, maps and agent numbers that were not seen in the training dataset.

<title>Accelerating Focal Search in Multi-Agent Path Finding with Tighter Lower Bounds</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a cost function--an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality with computational efficiency using focal search mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to address this issue by first determining the maximum LB value and then employing a best-first search guided by this LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases and is compatible with existing optimization techniques. DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level CT nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality bounds and optimizations.

<title>Pull-Based Query Scheduling for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by contrastively reducing language biases or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to capture fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. By magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities.

<title>The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory</title>

Abstract: High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. This method offers a scalable, pre-deployment evaluation without requiring student data, but its predictive validity concerning empirical IRT parameters is underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving 7,126 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (physical science, mathematics, and life/earth sciences). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life/earth and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors) and how they might make a question more or less challenging. Overall, our findings establish automated IWF analysis as a valuable supplement to traditional validation, providing an efficient method for initial item screening, particularly for flagging low-difficulty MCQs. Our findings show the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA at https://github.com/sungyeonparkk/NuPlanQA.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

Abstract: Cotraining with demonstration data generated both in simulation and on real hardware has emerged as a promising recipe for scaling imitation learning in robotics. This work seeks to elucidate basic principles of this sim-and-real cotraining to inform simulation design, sim-and-real dataset creation, and policy training. Our experiments confirm that cotraining with simulated data can dramatically improve performance, especially when real data is limited. We show that these performance gains scale with additional simulated data up to a plateau; adding more real-world data increases this performance ceiling. The results also suggest that reducing physical domain gaps may be more impactful than visual fidelity for non-prehensile or contact-rich tasks. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that some visual gap can help cotraining -- binary probes reveal that high-performing policies must learn to distinguish simulated domains from real. We conclude by investigating this nuance and mechanisms that facilitate positive transfer between sim-and-real. Focusing narrowly on the canonical task of planar pushing from pixels allows us to be thorough in our study. In total, our experiments span 50+ real-world policies (evaluated on 1000+ trials) and 250 simulated policies (evaluated on 50,000+ trials). Videos and code can be found at https://sim-and-real-cotraining.github.io/.

Abstract: Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) popularized by the release of GPT-3 and ChatGPT, LLMs have shown remarkable promise in programming-related tasks. While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.

Abstract: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Wide-angle cameras, despite their popularity for content creation, suffer from distortion-induced facial stretching-especially at the edge of the lens-which degrades visual appeal. To address this issue, we propose a structure-to-detail portrait correction model named ImagePC. It integrates the long-range awareness of the transformer and multi-step denoising of diffusion models into a unified framework, achieving global structural robustness and local detail refinement. Besides, considering the high cost of obtaining video labels, we then repurpose ImagePC for unlabeled wide-angle videos (termed VideoPC), by spatiotemporal diffusion adaption with spatial consistency and temporal smoothness constraints. For the former, we encourage the denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle distortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification trajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them. Compared with ImagePC, VideoPC maintains high-quality facial corrections in space and mitigates the potential temporal shakes sequentially in blind scenarios. Finally, to establish an evaluation benchmark and train the framework, we establish a video portrait dataset with a large diversity in the number of people, lighting conditions, and background. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing solutions quantitatively and qualitatively, contributing to high-fidelity wide-angle videos with stable and natural portraits.

Abstract: Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.

<title>RGB-Event based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: A Benchmark Dataset and An Asymmetric RWKV Fusion Framework</title>

Abstract: Existing pedestrian attribute recognition methods are generally developed based on RGB frame cameras. However, these approaches are constrained by the limitations of RGB cameras, such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and motion blur, which hinder their performance. Furthermore, current attribute recognition primarily focuses on analyzing pedestrians' external appearance and clothing, lacking an exploration of emotional dimensions. In this paper, we revisit these issues and propose a novel multi-modal RGB-Event attribute recognition task by drawing inspiration from the advantages of event cameras in low-light, high-speed, and low-power consumption. Specifically, we introduce the first large-scale multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition dataset, termed EventPAR, comprising 100K paired RGB-Event samples that cover 50 attributes related to both appearance and six human emotions, diverse scenes, and various seasons. By retraining and evaluating mainstream PAR models on this dataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and provide a solid foundation for future research in terms of data and algorithmic baselines. In addition, we propose a novel RWKV-based multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition framework, featuring an RWKV visual encoder and an asymmetric RWKV fusion module. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed dataset as well as two simulated datasets (MARS-Attribute and DukeMTMC-VID-Attribute), achieving state-of-the-art results. The source code and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

<title>CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476</link>

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

arXiv:2505.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

<title>What Lives? A meta-analysis of diverse opinions on the definition of life</title>

Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

<title>CAIN: Hijacking LLM-Humans Conversations via Malicious System Prompts</title>

arXiv:2505.16888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs' system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions (e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"), while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.

<title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose replacing text with speech as the instruction input modality for GUI agents, and introduce UITron-Speech, which is the first end-to-end GUI agent capable of directly processing speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict user actions. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, we synthesize high-quality speech instruction datasets using a random-speaker text-to-speech model. Additionally, we design a mixed-modality training strategy to mitigate the inherent modality imbalance in pre-trained foundation models. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of GUI grounding prediction errors and propose a training-free two-step grounding refinement method to alleviate minor localization deviations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UITron-Speech achieves robust performance and superior adaptability, underscoring the feasibility and potential of speech-driven GUI agents for more accessible and intelligent human-computer interaction. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/UITron-Speech.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified "broadcasting" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via "receiver" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: https://www.factral.co/UnMix-NeRF.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.

However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%. This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for enhancing model security The code and data are available at https://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to system-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the security of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our results also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

<title>True Multimodal In-Context Learning Needs Attention to the Visual Context</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are available at https://chenxshuo.github.io/true-micl-colm .

Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time. To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Memorization in generative models extends far beyond verbatim text reproduction--it manifests through non-literal patterns, semantic associations, and surprisingly, across modalities in transcript-conditioned generation tasks such as Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) and Text-to-Video (T2V) models. We reveal a new class of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak copyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to traditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with homophonic alternatives--e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic content. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized songs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the semantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE generate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original songs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on AudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and languages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music video--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no explicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an unprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend their training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright filters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around copyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys. Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses, scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while consuming significantly less energy.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

<title>NCCR: to Evaluate the Robustness of Neural Networks and Adversarial Examples</title>

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less robust.

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Summary:
XYZ-Drive is a vision-language model that integrates geometric accuracy and semantic understanding for autonomous driving tasks. It uses a goal-centered cross-attention layer to fuse information from front-camera frames, overhead maps, and waypoint tokens to generate steering and speed commands. The model outperforms existing methods on the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark, achieving high success rates and efficiency. Ablations show the importance of integrating vision, waypoint, and map modalities, as well as the benefits of fine-tuning the transformer model. The study highlights the significance of early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout for accurate, transparent, and real-time driving. Coarsening map resolution negatively impacts performance, indicating the importance of maintaining detailed map information for safe navigation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images) domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain, cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images. Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

Summary:<br />
This study examines the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness in modern agent systems, focusing on the cost-effective design of agents without compromising performance. Three key questions are explored: the inherent complexity of agentic tasks, the point of diminishing returns on additional modules, and the efficiency gains achievable through agent framework design. Through analysis on the GAIA benchmark, the study evaluates the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies on the cost-of-pass metric. The findings lead to the development of Efficient Agents, a new framework that balances complexity and task requirements, achieving a notable 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass compared to leading frameworks. This work provides practical guidance for designing efficient and high-performing agent systems, promoting the accessibility and sustainability of AI solutions.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

Summary:
This article challenges the Domain Closure Assumption in traditional planning models by allowing dynamic changes in the set of objects during action execution. It formulates the planning problem in first-order logic and discusses the finiteness of possible actions in each situation. By proposing a finite integer bound on plan length and organizing search over grounded action sequences, the approach ensures soundness and completeness. This method addresses bounded planning problems without the Domain Closure Assumption, falling within the intersection of sequential generalized planning and conformant planning. The implementation of the planner demonstrates a proof-of-concept for this novel approach. <div>
arXiv:2508.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However, there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals, discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan, and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences, making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse, realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework for future location-based research and applications.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, scientific discovery, reasoning models, cognitive loop, in-situ optimization

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO) that allows for deep control over the reasoning process in artificial intelligence (AI). This approach enables large language models (LLMs) to formulate problem-solving strategies, adapt behavior based on confidence levels, and provide scientists with final answers. It offers transparency and steerability in AI reasoning, allowing scientists to observe uncertainty levels, understand belief formation using graph structures, and make corrections. The use of CLIO with OpenAI's GPT-4.1 significantly improves accuracy in text-based biology and medicine questions, surpassing previous models' performance. The study also highlights the importance of internal uncertainty measures in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, demonstrating how its open design can enhance scientific decision-making processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific decision-making processes.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA, they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex reasoning.

<title>Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game</title>

<div> Keywords: planning, benchmark, countdown game, computational complexity, LLM-assisted planning

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the limitations of current planning benchmarks by introducing a new benchmark centered around the game called Countdown. This game involves forming a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations and is computationally challenging (NP-complete). The authors provide a theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity results and demonstrate the advantage of their instance generation procedure over existing benchmarks. They evaluate various LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using their procedure and show that their dynamic benchmark is extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches. This new benchmark meets the desiderata for an ideal benchmark, including intuitive problem description, computational complexity, and the avoidance of memorization. The results suggest that this benchmark can effectively evaluate planning capabilities in a more robust and challenging manner compared to existing benchmarks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Summary:
Post-training methods have proven to enhance the performance and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, applying these methods to Japanese LLMs has been challenging due to resource constraints. Drawing inspiration from task vectors used to extract weight changes before and after training for specific tasks, this study introduces reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs to boost Japanese LLMs' performance. Despite resource limitations, a simple and effective approach is proposed to improve Japanese LLMs significantly. This method aims to serve as a model for enhancing performance in other languages as well.

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement and hope to inspire for other languages.

Summary: PentestJudge is a system that uses a large language model to evaluate the operations of penetration testing agents. It employs rubrics with a hierarchical structure to break down tasks into smaller criteria for evaluation. The model's performance is compared to human experts, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 0.83. Models proficient in tool-use tend to perform closer to human experts. The study reveals that models with similar overall scores may struggle with different types of questions, suggesting varying abilities in judging operating criteria. Weaker models can effectively judge the actions of stronger models, indicating that verification may be simpler than generating actions in penetration testing. This methodology aims to support research in assessing the quality of AI-based security agents, enabling their safe deployment in sensitive environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model (LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft. LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be confidently used in sensitive production environments.

<div> Keywords: hydrologic modeling, language-based agent, vision-enabled, simulation, U.S. basins

Summary: 
AQUAH is an innovative language-based agent designed for hydrologic modeling that can autonomously perform simulations based on natural-language prompts. The agent retrieves necessary data, configures a hydrologic model, runs simulations, and generates reports without manual intervention. It utilizes vision-enabled large language models to interpret maps and make key decisions for the simulation. Initial experiments in various U.S. basins have shown that AQUAH produces clear, transparent, and physically plausible results, which are deemed analyst-ready by hydrologists. While further calibration and validation are required for operational use, the success of AQUAH demonstrates the potential of leveraging language models and vision technology to streamline complex environmental modeling processes, bridging the gap between Earth observation data and decision makers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to 2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear, transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data, physics-based tools, and decision makers.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal language models, clinical decision support, diagnostic reasoning, medical image interpretation, perceptual abilities

Summary: 
Multimodal language models (MLMs) have shown potential for clinical decision support and diagnostic reasoning in the medical field. However, the adoption of AI tools by clinicians is selective, and models that make errors on simple perception tasks are unlikely to be accepted for clinical use. To address this issue, the Medblink benchmark was created to evaluate MLMs on perceptual tasks related to medical imaging. The benchmark includes eight tasks across various modalities and anatomical regions, with a total of 1,429 multiple-choice questions. Evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLMs revealed that while human annotators achieved high accuracy, the best-performing model only reached 65%. These results highlight the need to improve the visual grounding of MLMs to support their adoption in clinical settings. The data for the benchmark is available on the project's webpage.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo, LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our project page.

arXiv:2508.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations. Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath, a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding, math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for next-generation LLMs.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new framework, BPO, to address challenges in applying Large Language Reasoning Models to multi-round agentic planning in interactive environments. The framework consists of three stages: bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement. It aims to overcome the intractable credit assignment problem in sparse-reward settings and reduce the computational overhead of verbose reasoning histories. By utilizing planning quaternions and chain-of-thought fusion, BPO bootstraps efficient reasoning and extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks through curriculum learning. The model further refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via reward-gated rejection sampling. Experimental results on various environments show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant token efficiency, providing a promising strategy for developing reasoning models in agentic planning. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework (bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in agentic planning.

<div> Keywords: Mixed-integer linear programming, neural networks, policy learning, collaboration, MILP solving 

Summary: 
Collab-Solver introduces a multi-agent-based policy learning framework that collaboratively optimizes policies for multiple modules in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. By formulating the collaboration of cut selection and branching as a Stackelberg game, the framework addresses the interdependence of policy learning modules. A two-phase learning paradigm is employed to stabilize collaborative policy learning, with the first phase focusing on data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase orchestrating policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy enhances solving performance on synthetic and real-world MILP datasets and exhibits excellent generalization capabilities across different instance sets. This approach represents a significant improvement over existing methods, which often treat policy learning in MILP solvers independently, resulting in reduced solving speed and quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors explore the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By conditioning on examples embedded in prompts, the LLMs, specifically GPT-2 models, demonstrate the ability to learn a meta-ODE algorithm effectively. The experiments conducted show that GPT-2 can solve ODE problems with convergence behavior comparable to or better than the Euler method. Additionally, the model exhibits exponential accuracy gains as the number of demonstrations increases and showcases robust extrapolation capabilities to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms of ICL in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and highlight its potential in solving nonlinear numerical problems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel multi-agent framework called Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR) to address the limitations of existing large language models (LLMs) in complex medical diagnosis tasks. The framework utilizes a tree structure to capture the reasoning path of LLMs and clinical evidence, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy in the medical domain. Additionally, a cross-validation mechanism is proposed to enhance the consistency of decision-making among the multi-agents, thereby enhancing their clinical reasoning capabilities in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data demonstrate that the ToR framework outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of diagnostic performance. This innovative approach aims to overcome the challenges faced by current LLMs in processing specialized medical data effectively and accurately.

arXiv:2508.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios. Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance than existing baseline methods.

<div> Keywords: large language models, jailbreak attacks, Cognitive-Driven Defense, meta-operations, entropy-guided reinforcement learning <br />
Summary: <br />
Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is crucial for their secure deployment. Existing defense mechanisms often struggle to adapt to new and unseen attack strategies. To address this issue, the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework is proposed, which focuses on the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by using meta-operations to conceal harmful intent. CDD mimics human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain, starting with a global perception of the prompt and then analyzing localized manipulations. Through supervised fine-tuning and entropy-guided reinforcement learning, CDD learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns while also exploring new types and variants of meta-operations for enhanced generalization to unseen threats. Experimental results show that CDD achieves superior defense performance and robust generalization to unfamiliar jailbreak attacks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats, an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

<title>ContractEval: Benchmarking LLMs for Clause-Level Legal Risk Identification in Commercial Contracts</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, legal risk analysis, open-source, ContractEval, CUAD

Summary:<br /><br />Proprietary language models outperform open-source models in correctness and effectiveness for identifying legal risks in contracts. Larger open-source models perform better, although performance improvement slows with increased size. Reasoning mode enhances output effectiveness but diminishes correctness due to complex task handling. Open-source models exhibit higher "no related clause" responses, possibly indicating a lack of deep thinking or confidence in extracting relevant content. Model quantization accelerates inference but reduces performance, emphasizing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These findings indicate that open-source language models may require specific fine-tuning for accurate and effective performance in legal contexts. The ContractEval benchmark provides valuable insights for future development of legal-oriented language models.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better, though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning ("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Summary: 
Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) has seen success but struggles with generalization. Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD) is introduced to generate a small, diverse set of complementary heuristics for different problem instances. The AHSD objective function is shown to be monotone and supermodular. Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) implements AHSD for LLM-driven AHD, utilizing complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search. EoH-S outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 60% performance improvements across various tasks and instances. <div>

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances, often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings. To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances, such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics. Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\% performance improvements.

Summary: 
Diffusion models are useful for imputing missing data by modeling observed and unobserved variables jointly. Current methods, like stochastic denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have drawbacks such as high inference latency and variable outputs. These limitations hinder their practical use in real-world tabular scenarios. To overcome these issues, MissDDIM introduces a conditional diffusion framework that utilizes Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling allows for diverse completions, it also leads to output variability, making downstream processing more complex. The proposed framework aims to address these challenges and enhance the applicability of diffusion models for tabular data imputation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings. To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

<div> Keywords: CLIP, unlearnable examples, data protection, privacy, text-to-image (T2I) model

Summary:   
Unlearnable Examples (UEs) are used as a countermeasure to unauthorized model training in large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP. However, the current approaches of generating UEs through joint optimization of noise for images and text descriptions pose privacy concerns as they rely on external services. To address this, the Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE) framework is introduced, allowing users to generate UEs using only text descriptions, eliminating the need for original image data exposure. T2UE leverages a text-to-image model and an error-minimization framework to create effective unlearnable noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of T2UE in degrading performance in downstream tasks for various models, showcasing its data protection capabilities. This zero-contact data protection approach highlights the feasibility of safeguarding personal data solely based on textual descriptions, paving the way for practical and scalable privacy-preserving solutions.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments.

Summary:
AgentSME is a generative agent framework for smart education using LLM technology. It considers three communication modes - Solo, Mono, and Echo - to capture different levels of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. The framework is evaluated based on accuracy and diversity of reasoning contents across six LLM models in base and high-capacity configurations. Results show that agents using the Echo communication mode achieve highest accuracy scores, with DeepSeek exhibiting the most diversity. This study highlights the importance of communication modes in improving agent learning capabilities for personalized human-to-human communication in educational contexts. <div>

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo, Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM) agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations, multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7 datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents for real-world optimization applications.

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation, helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated from available data before attempting to estimate how strong that relationship is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous identification algorithms from the recent causal inference literature. The $Y_0$ source code can be found under the MIT License at https://github.com/y0-causal-inference/y0 and it can be installed with pip install y0.

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams. Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Summary:
- The article discusses the importance of modeling evolving interactions among entities in various real-world tasks.
- It introduces a full-history graph for temporal-graph representation, separating intra-time-step and inter-time-step edges.
- The Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) is designed to learn on this graph, with parallel modules for graph and temporal attention.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance. The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

Summary: 
Nemori presents a new memory architecture, inspired by human cognitive principles, to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for long-term interactions. The Two-Step Alignment Principle organizes conversational streams into coherent episodes, addressing the issue of memory granularity. The Predict-Calibrate Principle allows the agent to learn from prediction gaps, enabling adaptive knowledge evolution beyond heuristics. This architecture outperforms existing systems in handling long-term workflows, particularly in longer contexts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks showcase Nemori's superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Overall, Nemori offers a promising solution to the limitations faced by autonomous agents in maintaining persistent memory in dynamic interactions. 

Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2508.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive, multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding of reasoning structures.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by large language models in general logical reasoning and the emerging interest in neurosymbolic AI. It compares two main approaches, the integrative approach and the hybrid approach, in enhancing logical reasoning. The study introduces two models, LNN and LLM-SS, representing each approach, and analyzes their potential for developing general logical reasoning. The analysis shows that the hybrid approach is more promising, as it offers more interpretable reasoning chains and retains the advantages of existing LLMs. To support future research using the hybrid approach, a modular and model-agnostic framework based on LLM-SS is proposed, emphasizing its adaptability across domains with minimal human input. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

arXiv:2508.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in reasoning and generation tasks but struggle with error identification and diagnosis. To address this limitation, a dynamic adversarial framework called the Hide and Seek Game (HSG) is proposed for error generation and diagnosis, focusing on mathematical problem-solving. In HSG, two roles, namely Sneaky and Diagnosis, engage in an adversarial co-evolution to enhance error stealth and diagnostic precision. The framework significantly improves error diagnosis accuracy, outperforming baseline models like GPT-4o by 16.8% to 31.4%. Additionally, a dataset of deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations is released to serve as a benchmark for future research initiatives.<br /><br />Summary: The HSG framework introduces an innovative approach to enhancing error diagnosis in large language models, particularly in mathematical problem-solving tasks. By fostering dynamic adversarial interactions between error generation and diagnostic roles, HSG achieves notable improvements in error detection accuracy compared to traditional methods. The release of a deceptive error dataset further contributes to the advancement of research in error diagnosis within LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors. This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers, limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this, we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle, deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

By considering both path cost and constraint violation, MOID generates a set of trade-off solutions that offer actionable suggestions for restoring model feasibility. Utilizing LLM agents, MOID analyzes these diverse solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with valuable insights and suggestions for decision-making. The comparison with existing LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems demonstrates that MOID offers multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, offering practical solutions for restoring model feasibility and aiding decision-making.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions. Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

<title>Toward a Graph-Theoretic Model of Belief: Confidence, Credibility, and Structural Coherence</title>

<div> Graph theory, Belief systems, Epistemic relationships, Credibility, Confidence  
Summary:  
- Belief systems are often represented as consistent sets of propositions or probability distributions, but this overlooks their internal structure and contradictions.   
- A new formalism is introduced using directed, weighted graphs where nodes represent beliefs and edges represent relationships like support or contradiction.   
- Credibility and confidence functions are assigned to beliefs, reflecting trust in sources and internal support respectively.   
- Unlike traditional models, this approach does not require coherence or belief updating and allows for fine-grained structural representation.  
- The model is static, focusing on belief organization rather than inference or revision.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction), and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

<div> Keywords: smart home, behavior data, anomaly detection, behavior prediction, continual adaptation

Summary: 
SmartGen is a framework for synthesizing user behavior data in smart homes to support continual adaptation of intelligent models. It addresses the issue of behavioral drift caused by changes in routines or lifestyle. The framework consists of four main components: Time and Semantic-aware Split module, Semantic-aware Sequence Compression, Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, and Two-stage Outlier Filter. These components work together to divide behavior sequences, compress input data, guide data generation aligned with contextual changes, and filter out implausible outputs. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SmartGen significantly improves performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift. Anomaly detection performance improved by 85.43% on average, and behavior prediction improved by 70.51%. The code for SmartGen is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

Summary:  <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines. However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at https://github.com/horizonsinzqs/SmartGen.

Summary: 
Large language models have shown the ability to perform multi-step reasoning but often make errors that propagate. They struggle with hallucinations and formatting issues, particularly in tasks like generating mathematical expressions. To address this, the EDCIM method is introduced for interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must provide the exact functional form to solve a problem explicitly. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate equations and a symbolic error-detection framework to identify and correct errors. By integrating lightweight open-source LLMs with more powerful models, EDCIM balances cost and accuracy with a single hyperparameter. Experimental results demonstrate that EDCIM significantly reduces computational and financial costs while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy when properly configured. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However, their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving, prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

<div> Keywords: Massive activations, Transformer training, Pythia model, Mathematical modeling, Machine learning framework

Summary:
The study explores the emergence and dynamics of massive activations in transformer models during training. Through analyzing the Pythia model family at various training checkpoints, the researchers found that massive activation development follows predictable mathematical patterns. They developed a machine learning framework to predict the key parameters governing massive activation emergence from architectural specifications. The framework achieved high accuracy in predicting steady-state behavior and moderate accuracy in emergence timing and magnitude. The findings suggest that architects can potentially control massive activation emergence through design choices before training. This has significant implications for model stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. The study demonstrates that massive activations are influenced by model design and can be anticipated and managed proactively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before training begins.

<div> Keywords: code generation, faulty premises, large language models, evaluation framework, reasoning abilities

Summary: 
Most large language models (LLMs) struggle with code generation when presented with faulty premises, relying heavily on explicit prompts for error detection and lacking self-scrutiny capabilities. Increasing resource investment does not necessarily improve code generation quality, as there is a point of diminishing returns. Different types of faulty premises activate distinct defect patterns in LLMs, revealing a triple dissociation in their cognitive mechanisms of code generation. The study emphasizes the importance of LLMs proactively verifying premises in code generation and introduces the Faulty Premises Bench (FPBench) framework for evaluating code generation performance under faulty premises. The multi-dimensional evaluation system provided in the study offers a theoretical foundation and practical pathway for developing more reliable and human-centric code generation models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models (LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench (FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1) Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models, revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code generation models.

<title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Gravitational-Wave Detection Guided by LLM-Informed Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

arXiv:2508.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference. However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement. FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research initiatives.

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75 survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework, AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity, usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines, enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in real-world situations.

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour. Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes - Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity, and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92% macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

<title>ZetA: A Riemann Zeta-Scaled Extension of Adam for Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings. The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity classification tasks.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm, while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges: extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage, the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

<title>Blueprint First, Model Second: A Framework for Deterministic LLM Workflow</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02721</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM) agents limits their application in structured operational environments where procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic, high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark, designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict procedural logic.

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations, eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made public when this paper is published.

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences, and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of 0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics and beyond.

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer, and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably support formative evaluation and professional development. This work demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale within academic institutions.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS) system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3 models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good ``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line) data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures. Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences, preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12 billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation, yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool. These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into high-stakes academic workflows.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors. To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications. DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851, representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed, affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB control.

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms. We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a 238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score, ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds. Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB, along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.

Abstract: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work (1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain. \textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the \emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the \emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably, \textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy development.

Rooted in the traditions of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanism, the concept of "Cyber Humanities" proposes a critical reconfiguration of humanistic inquiry for the post-digital era. This Manifesto introduces a flexible framework that integrates ethical design, sustainable digital practices, and participatory knowledge systems grounded in human-centered approaches. By means of a Decalogue of foundational principles, the Manifesto invites the scientific community to critically examine and reimagine the algorithmic infrastructures that influence culture, creativity, and collective memory.
  Rather than being a simple extension of existing practices, "Cyber Humanities" should be understood as a foundational paradigm for humanistic inquiry in a computationally mediated world.
  Keywords: Cyber Humanities, Digital Humanities, Transdisciplinary Epistemology, Algorithmic Reflexivity, Human-centered AI, Ethics-by-Design, Knowledge Ecosystems, Digital Sovereignty, Cognitive Infrastructures

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2) developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition, semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate markets.

<title>The Silicon Reasonable Person: Can AI Predict How Ordinary People Judge Reasonableness?</title>

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions, understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.

<title>Extracting Range-Doppler Information of Moving Targets from Wi-Fi Channel State Information</title>

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or specialized full-duplex capabilities.

<title>Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Device-Directed Speech Detection</title>

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free (follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

<title>Clinically Grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation: An Interpretable Metric for Radiology Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment. Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error patterns.

<title>Real-World Receptivity to Adaptive Mental Health Interventions: Findings from an In-the-Wild Study</title>

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior research has examined how context affects user responses to generic notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions. Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components: acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions. The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility, and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also actionable in real-world settings.

<title>NeuroSync: Intent-Aware Code-Based Problem Solving via Direct LLM Understanding Modification</title>

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to higher episodic returns.

<title>Automated Validation of LLM-based Evaluators for Software Engineering Artifacts</title>

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1) discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual targets.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding, such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion), insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity, paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence. Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps. The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo, code, and model weights.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers, we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such, it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper, we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity. Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction methodologies and detection algorithms.

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence. Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300 times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable, the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability, particularly as environmental complexity increases.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems, powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning, and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants, workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains, acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static, benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation, complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference outputs to illustrate the need and method.

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead. To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving, logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven, compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of scaling laws in recommender systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a parameterization framework for controlling conversation quality in large language models. We explore nine key parameters across six dimensions that enable precise specification of dialogue properties. Through experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that parameter-based control produces statistically significant differences in generated conversation properties. Our approach addresses challenges in conversation generation, including topic coherence, knowledge progression, character consistency, and control granularity. The framework provides a standardized method for conversation quality control with applications in education, therapy, customer service, and entertainment. Future work will focus on implementing additional parameters through architectural modifications and developing benchmark datasets for evaluation.

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of 0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model, combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne pathogen risks.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning, a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks. We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1% higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each domain.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation, and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment. Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG. The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability. Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization. The results also show that improved localization performance translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective strategy for improving automated software development.

<title>SkeNa: Learning to Navigate Unseen Environments Based on Abstract Hand-Drawn Maps</title>

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71 indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor (DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105% relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

<title>Uncertainty-Guided Face Matting for Occlusion-Aware Face Transformation</title>

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at https://github.com/hyebin-c/FaceMat.git

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage, based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels. A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local information within global features is introduced to enhance learning comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/TrinhQuocNguyen/CORE-ReID.

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs. However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%. Our work underscores the potential challenges posed by multiplicative attacks and highlights the need for more robust AMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a Bipedal Robot.

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized environments, the need for standardized registry systems to support discovery, identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources. To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning (SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery, cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol (MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles, extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks, and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control (AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration, positioning the foundation for next-generation autonomous intelligent systems.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels. However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology, resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap, we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of HiTeC.

<title>Pseudo-label Induced Subspace Representation Learning for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework.

<title>GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance</title>

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting, it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

<title>NANDA Adaptive Resolver: Architecture for Dynamic Resolution of AI Agent Names</title>

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs, AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents. The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model. AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in real-time, resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87.

<title>Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph and Literary Theory</title>

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability, termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original long CoT reasoning capability.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

<title>CoTox: Chain-of-Thought-Based Molecular Toxicity Reasoning and Prediction</title>

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking. Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1 and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15 participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with 10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid, accessible, and engaging.

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density, spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models. Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content, they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users' interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies, which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms. Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD. This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging, even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis. We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

<title>Approximate Proportionality in Online Fair Division</title>

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality. To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation.

<title>Pay What LLM Wants: Can LLM Simulate Economics Experiment with 522 Real-human Persona?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real 522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based simulation in computational social science.

Abstract: High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are discovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving quickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the 'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models, physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare, and energy innovation.

<title>Investigating Gender Bias in LLM-Generated Stories via Psychological Stereotypes</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

<title>Reliable Evaluation Protocol for Low-Precision Retrieval</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned: many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16 baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

Abstract: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous, non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models, combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess, structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the demands of 6G.

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51 styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks, we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists, remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks. To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task, especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running 1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video segmentation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics, including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved. However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention. Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph, input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.

<title>LLMs Have a Heart of Stone: Demystifying the Soft Thinking Ability of Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio, highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity. Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the baseline methods.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency. This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85% remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in large-scale industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format. These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems finetuned on table and text data.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks. We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits, applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control (conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods, applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10 metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and cross-domain generalizability.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently, with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses (micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution. However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics. MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF) distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

<title>Block: Balancing Load in LLM Serving with Context, Knowledge and Predictive Scheduling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03611</link>

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations. Code and data are open-sourced.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler; (3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47 problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2 achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at https://github.com/Goedel-LM/Goedel-Prover-V2.

Abstract: We present Attention Zoom, a modular and model-agnostic spatial attention mechanism designed to improve feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional attention approaches that require architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy. Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with minimal architectural overhead.

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability, alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments, we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled design of robust learning systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants. Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions, assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses, and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

<title>Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03663</link>

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm, with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom. This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity. These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept of freedom in AI regulation.

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess, trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31 interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge, enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI use.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier.

Abstract: Computational models of purposeful behavior comprise both descriptive and prescriptive aspects, used respectively to ascertain and evaluate situations in the world. In reinforcement learning, prescriptive reward functions are assumed to depend on predefined and fixed descriptive state representations. Alternatively, these two aspects may emerge interdependently: goals can shape the acquired state representations and vice versa. Here, we present a computational framework for state representation learning in bounded agents, where descriptive and prescriptive aspects are coupled through the notion of goal-directed, or telic, states. We introduce the concept of telic-controllability to characterize the tradeoff between the granularity of a telic state representation and the policy complexity required to reach all telic states. We propose an algorithm for learning telic-controllable state representations, illustrating it using a simulated navigation task. Our framework highlights the role of deliberate ignorance -- knowing what to ignore -- for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and cognitive complexity.

Abstract: Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Game theory is a foundational framework for analyzing strategic interactions, and its intersection with large language models (LLMs) is a rapidly growing field. However, existing surveys mainly focus narrowly on using game theory to evaluate LLM behavior. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of the bidirectional relationship between Game Theory and LLMs. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes the research in this intersection into four distinct perspectives: (1) evaluating LLMs in game-based scenarios; (2) improving LLMs using game-theoretic concepts for better interpretability and alignment; (3) modeling the competitive landscape of LLM development and its societal impact; and (4) leveraging LLMs to advance game models and to solve corresponding game theory problems. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions. By systematically investigating this interdisciplinary landscape, our survey highlights the mutual influence of game theory and LLMs, fostering progress at the intersection of these fields.

Abstract: With the advancement of web techniques, they have significantly revolutionized various aspects of people's lives. Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.

Abstract: Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.

Abstract: Dynamic scheduling in real-world environments often struggles to adapt to unforeseen disruptions, making traditional static scheduling methods and human-designed heuristics inadequate. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance. Antidistillation sampling provides exactly this capability. By strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution, antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's practical utility.

<title>From Promising Capability to Pervasive Bias: Assessing Large Language Models for Emergency Department Triage</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical decision support, yet their application to triage remains underexplored. We systematically investigate the capabilities of LLMs in emergency department triage through two key dimensions: (1) robustness to distribution shifts and missing data, and (2) counterfactual analysis of intersectional biases across sex and race. We assess multiple LLM-based approaches, ranging from continued pre-training to in-context learning, as well as machine learning approaches. Our results indicate that LLMs exhibit superior robustness, and we investigate the key factors contributing to the promising LLM-based approaches. Furthermore, in this setting, we identify gaps in LLM preferences that emerge in particular intersections of sex and race. LLMs generally exhibit sex-based differences, but they are most pronounced in certain racial groups. These findings suggest that LLMs encode demographic preferences that may emerge in specific clinical contexts or particular combinations of characteristics.

Abstract: Evaluating the open-ended outputs of Large Multimodal Models has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality rapidly expand. Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Then, building upon this taxonomy, we create FRABench, a fine-grained evaluation dataset comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. FRABench provides a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource for training and testing evaluators. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.

<title>Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments</title>

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.

Abstract: Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory} (UCCT) casts them instead as vast unconscious pattern repositories: apparent reasoning arises only when external anchoring mechanisms, few shot prompts, retrieval-augmented context, fine-tuning, or multi-agent debate, activate task-relevant patterns. UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object) extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization, and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results, particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format. Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Abstract: Pain is a complex and pervasive condition that affects a significant portion of the population. Accurate and consistent assessment is essential for individuals suffering from pain, as well as for developing effective management strategies in a healthcare system. Automatic pain assessment systems enable continuous monitoring, support clinical decision-making, and help minimize patient distress while mitigating the risk of functional deterioration. Leveraging physiological signals offers objective and precise insights into a person's state, and their integration in a multimodal framework can further enhance system performance. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed approach introduces \textit{Tiny-BioMoE}, a lightweight pretrained embedding model for biosignal analysis. Trained on $4.4$ million biosignal image representations and consisting of only $7.3$ million parameters, it serves as an effective tool for extracting high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments involving electrodermal activity, blood volume pulse, respiratory signals, peripheral oxygen saturation, and their combinations highlight the model's effectiveness across diverse modalities in automatic pain recognition tasks. \textit{\textcolor{blue}{The model's architecture (code) and weights are available at https://github.com/GkikasStefanos/Tiny-BioMoE.

Abstract: Tensor parallelism is an essential technique for distributed training of large neural networks. However, automatically determining an optimal tensor parallel strategy is challenging due to the gigantic search space, which grows exponentially with model size and tensor dimension. This prohibits the adoption of auto-parallel systems on larger models.
  We observe that neural networks usually contain repeated substructures, and build an automatic parallelism framework named TAPAS that eliminates redundant search efforts. TAPAS employs a divide-and-conquer approach that efficiently folds the search space by identifying those unique substructures. As a result, it runs at sub-linear complexity concerning the model size, making it a scalable solution for training large-scale networks. Our evaluations demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the state-of-the-art automatic parallelism frameworks by up to $160\times$ in search speed on a wide range of models, and the performance of derived strategies is competitive or even better compared with the expert-engineered Megatron-LM library.

Abstract: Despite significant efforts towards extending the AGM paradigm of belief change beyond finitary logics, the computational aspects of AGM have remained almost untouched. We investigate the computability of AGM contraction on non-finitary logics, and show an intriguing negative result: there are infinitely many uncomputable AGM contraction functions in such logics. Drastically, we also show that the current de facto standard strategies to control computability, which rely on restricting the space of epistemic states, fail: uncomputability remains in all non-finitary cases. Motivated by this disruptive result, we propose new approaches to controlling computability beyond the finitary realm. Using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) as a case study, we identify an infinite class of fully-rational AGM contraction functions that are computable by design. We use B\"uchi automata to construct such functions, and to represent and reason about LTL beliefs.

<title>IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves</title>

Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: Wireless ray-tracing (RT) is emerging as a key tool for three-dimensional (3D) wireless channel modeling, driven by advances in graphical rendering. Current approaches struggle to accurately model beyond 5G (B5G) network signaling, which often operates at higher frequencies and is more susceptible to environmental conditions and changes. Existing online learning solutions require real-time environmental supervision during training, which is both costly and incompatible with GPU-based processing. In response, we propose a novel approach that redefines ray trajectory generation as a sequential decision-making problem, leveraging generative models to jointly learn the optical, physical, and signal properties within each designated environment. Our work introduces the Scene-Aware Neural Decision Wireless Channel Raytracing Hierarchy (SANDWICH), an innovative offline, fully differentiable approach that can be trained entirely on GPUs. SANDWICH offers superior performance compared to existing online learning methods, outperforms the baseline by 4e^-2 radian in RT accuracy, and only fades 0.5 dB away from toplined channel gain estimation.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks. Source code and models are publicly available at: https://lorebianchi98.github.io/Talk2DINO/.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.

Abstract: An image may convey a thousand words, but a video composed of hundreds or thousands of image frames tells a more intricate story. Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.

Abstract: The average-reward formulation of reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increased interest in recent years for its ability to solve temporally-extended problems without relying on discounting. Meanwhile, in the discounted setting, algorithms with entropy regularization have been developed, leading to improvements over deterministic methods. Despite the distinct benefits of these approaches, deep RL algorithms for the entropy-regularized average-reward objective have not been developed. While policy-gradient based approaches have recently been presented for the average-reward literature, the corresponding actor-critic framework remains less explored. In this paper, we introduce an average-reward soft actor-critic algorithm to address these gaps in the field. We validate our method by comparing with existing average-reward algorithms on standard RL benchmarks, achieving superior performance for the average-reward criterion.

We first introduce Robin - a novel suite of VLMs that we built by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Encoders (VEs) at multiple scales, and use Robin to identify shortcomings of current evaluation approaches across scales. Next, to overcome the identified limitations, we introduce CHIRP - a new long form response benchmark we developed for more robust and complete VLM evaluation. We provide open access to the Robin training code, model suite, and CHIRP benchmark to promote reproducibility and advance VLM research.

Abstract: Wireless positioning technologies hold significant value for applications in autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based cellular positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven cellular positioning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of wireless positioning and AI models, analyzing their respective challenges and synergies. We provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with a focus on the integration of AI/ML in current and upcoming standard releases. Guided by the 3GPP-defined taxonomy, we categorize and summarize state-of-the-art (SOTA) research into two major classes: AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML-based positioning. The former includes line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle prediction; the latter encompasses fingerprinting, knowledge-assisted learning, and channel charting. Furthermore, we review representative public datasets and conduct performance evaluations of AI-based positioning algorithms using these datasets. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. Although these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly between languages due to the imbalanced distribution of training data. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

<title>CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements</title>

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.

<title>Entropy-Lens: The Information Signature of Transformer Computations</title>

Abstract: Transformer models map input token sequences to output token distributions, layer by layer. While most interpretability work focuses on internal latent representations, we study the evolution of these token-level distributions directly in vocabulary space. However, such distributions are high-dimensional and defined on an unordered support, making common descriptors like moments or cumulants ill-suited. We address this by computing the Shannon entropy of each intermediate predicted distribution, yielding one interpretable scalar per layer. The resulting sequence, the entropy profile, serves as a compact, information-theoretic signature of the model's computation. We introduce Entropy-Lens, a model-agnostic framework that extracts entropy profiles from frozen, off-the-shelf transformers. We show that these profiles (i) reveal family-specific computation patterns invariant under depth rescaling, (ii) are predictive of prompt type and task format, and (iii) correlate with output correctness. We further show that R\'enyi entropies yield similar results within a broad range of $\alpha$ values, justifying the use of Shannon entropy as a stable and principled summary. Our results hold across different transformers, without requiring gradients, fine-tuning, or access to model internals.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics. A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities in code generation, natural language understanding, and domain-specific reasoning. Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.

Abstract: Image quality plays an important role in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been widely shown to exhibit sensitivity to changes in imaging conditions. Conventional image quality assessment (IQA) seeks to measure and align quality relative to human perceptual judgments, but we often need a metric that is not only sensitive to imaging conditions but also well-aligned with DNN sensitivities. We first ask whether conventional IQA metrics are also informative of DNN performance. We show theoretically and empirically that conventional IQA metrics are weak predictors of DNN performance for image classification. Using our causal framework, we then develop metrics that exhibit strong correlation with DNN performance, thus enabling us to effectively estimate the quality distribution of large image datasets relative to targeted vision tasks.

<title>M2S: Multi-turn to Single-turn jailbreak in Red Teaming for LLMs</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.

Abstract: Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings (~ 1% data). Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/.

Abstract: Gradient optimization-based adversarial attack methods automate the learning of adversarial triggers to generate jailbreak prompts or leak system prompts. In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs. We released our code \href{https://github.com/QData/ALTA_Augmented_Adversarial_Trigger_Learning}{here}.

Abstract: Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) are foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent outputs and exhibit biases, limiting their representation of diverse language patterns. The closed-source nature of many powerful LLMs further restricts industry applications due to data privacy concerns. Inspired by successes in text generation, LLM ensemble techniques are now increasingly explored for code generation. This article reviews these emerging ensemble approaches to enhance understanding, encourage further research, and promote practical implementation in both text and code generation. We categorize LLM ensembles into seven main methods - weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture-of-experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading - analyzing capabilities of those approaches. Our findings highlight key benefits such as improved diversity representation, enhanced output quality, and greater application flexibility. These insights aid model selection for real-world tasks and crucially, lay groundwork for extending ensemble strategies to multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving. Code and data are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/ADSEdit.md.

<title>Boosting Omnidirectional Stereo Matching with a Pre-trained Depth Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Omnidirectional depth perception is essential for mobile robotics applications that require scene understanding across a full 360{\deg} field of view. Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.

Abstract: Architecture design and optimization are challenging problems in the field of artificial neural networks. Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.

Abstract: Single-photon Lidar imaging offers a significant advantage in 3D imaging due to its high resolution and long-range capabilities, however it is challenging to apply in noisy environments with multiple targets per pixel. To tackle these challenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate interpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in their ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack interpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar imaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and propose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To support multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit geometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed method takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in terms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared to existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ERW.

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks but suffer from immense computational and memory demands, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/LawrenceRLiu/NoWag

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in eight languages (Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, German, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

<title>FFCBA: Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, as backdoored models would misclassify poisoned samples with specific triggers into target classes while maintaining normal performance on clean samples. Among these, multi-target backdoor attacks can simultaneously target multiple classes. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks all follow the dirty-label paradigm, where poisoned samples are mislabeled, and most of them require an extremely high poisoning rate. This makes them easily detectable by manual inspection. In contrast, clean-label attacks are more stealthy, as they avoid modifying the labels of poisoned samples. However, they generally struggle to achieve stable and satisfactory attack performance and often fail to scale effectively to multi-target attacks. To address this issue, we propose the Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks (FFCBA) which consists of two paradigms: Feature-Spanning Backdoor Attacks (FSBA) and Feature-Migrating Backdoor Attacks (FMBA). FSBA leverages class-conditional autoencoders to generate noise triggers that align perturbed in-class samples with the original category's features, ensuring the effectiveness, intra-class consistency, inter-class specificity and natural-feature correlation of triggers. While FSBA supports swift and efficient attacks, its cross-model attack capability is relatively weak. FMBA employs a two-stage class-conditional autoencoder training process that alternates between using out-of-class samples and in-class samples. This allows FMBA to generate triggers with strong target-class features, making it highly effective for cross-model attacks. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models, the results show that FFCBA achieves outstanding attack performance and maintains desirable robustness against the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a viable alternative to conditional generation.

<title>GRILL: Gradient Signal Restoration in Ill-Conditioned Layers to Enhance Adversarial Attacks on Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of deep autoencoders (AEs) remains relatively unexplored, even though their non-invertible nature poses distinct challenges. Existing attack algorithms during the optimization of imperceptible, norm-bounded adversarial perturbations to maximize output damage in AEs, often stop at sub-optimal attacks. We observe that the adversarial loss gradient vanishes when backpropagated through ill-conditioned layers. This issue arises from near-zero singular values in the Jacobians of these layers, which weaken the gradient signal during optimization. We introduce GRILL, a technique that locally restores gradient signals in ill-conditioned layers, enabling more effective norm-bounded attacks. Through extensive experiments on different architectures of popular AEs, under both sample-specific and universal attack setups, and across standard and adaptive attack settings, we show that our method significantly increases the effectiveness of our adversarial attacks, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of AE robustness.

Abstract: Optical computing systems deliver unrivalled processing speeds for scalar operations. Yet, integrated implementations have been constrained to low-dimensional tensor operations that fall short of the vector dimensions required for modern artificial intelligence. We demonstrate an all-optical neuromorphic computing system based on time division multiplexing, capable of processing input vectors exceeding 250,000 elements within a unified framework. The platform harnesses optically driven thermo-optic modulation in standing wave optical fields, with titanium nano-antennas functioning as wavelength-selective absorbers. Counterintuitively, the thermal time dynamics of the system enable simultaneous time integration of ultra-fast (50GHz) signals and the application of programmable, non-linear activation functions, entirely within the optical domain. This unified framework constitutes a leap towards large-scale photonic computing that satisfies the dimensional requirements of AI workloads.

Abstract: Modern automotive infotainment systems necessitate intelligent and adaptive solutions to manage frequent User Interface (UI) updates and diverse design variations. This work introduces a vision-language framework to facilitate the understanding of and interaction with automotive UIs, enabling seamless adaptation across different UI designs. To support research in this field, AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset comprising 998 images with 4,208 annotations, is also released. Additionally, a data pipeline for generating training data is presented. A Molmo-7B-based model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa), incorporating generated reasoning along with visual grounding and evaluation capabilities. The fine-tuned Evaluative Large Action Model (ELAM) achieves strong performance on AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K (model and dataset are available on Hugging Face). The approach demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization, including a +5.6% improvement on ScreenSpot over the baseline model. An average accuracy of 80.8% is achieved on ScreenSpot, closely matching or surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and web, despite being trained primarily on the automotive domain. This research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead to AI-driven advancements in automotive UI understanding and interaction. The applied method is cost-efficient, and fine-tuned models can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 27,247 QA pairs and 19,615 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data pre-processing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 20 open-source LMMs and 4 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work. Data and code can be accessed at https://rssysu.github.io/AgroMind/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.

Abstract: R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has substantial influence on RL but shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring \textbf{sample effect}. Our hypothetical analysis shows the potential to improve SFT efficiency. Guided by our analysis, we propose \textbf{Re-distillation}, a technique that aims to boost the effectiveness of small-scale distillation by sampling from the RL-trained policy. Re-distillation shows consistent surprising efficiency on three datasets and both Qwen\&amp;Llama models: Re-distilled models matched RL performance with far fewer samples and less computation. As a result, on K\&amp;K dataset, our re-distilled Qwen-2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT samples. We demonstrate that re-distillation can be used to efficiently balance multiple goals in RL. Our work explains several interesting phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical success. Code is available at: https://github.com/on1262/deep-reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware design automation, particularly in Verilog code generation. However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across nearly all fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

<title>Causally Steered Diffusion for Automated Video Counterfactual Generation</title>

Abstract: Adapting text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models (LDMs) to video editing has shown strong visual fidelity and controllability, but challenges remain in maintaining causal relationships inherent to the video data generating process. Edits affecting causally dependent attributes often generate unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we introduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, formulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior causal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into text prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using a vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the latent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of counterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful alternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates causally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via prompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness without compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world facial videos. Due to its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our framework has significant potential to generate realistic 'what if' hypothetical video scenarios in diverse areas such as digital media and healthcare.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice (Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length. Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

<title>Reasoning or Memorization? Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination</title>

Abstract: Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods.

Abstract: In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages, outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains. Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work enhances the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation. However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions, are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary \underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew \underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation (\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities. Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this area.

<title>P3SL: Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning on Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7 devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop, using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a challenge. In this paper, we identify high learning rates as a facilitator for simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is related to addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset. Our investigation of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon reveals the importance of confident mispredictions of bias-conflicting samples under large learning rates.

<title>FedSA-GCL: A Semi-Asynchronous Federated Graph Learning Framework with Personalized Aggregation and Cluster-Aware Broadcasting</title>

arXiv:2507.18219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training. We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present SemiSegECG, the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that SemiSegECG will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.

arXiv:2507.18847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation -- i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones. This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically, we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving higher performance with only a modest computational overhead.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.

arXiv:2507.20252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence () token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.

<title>From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2507.20968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that govern domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists of three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 scenarios and ranking first across all benchmarks.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.

arXiv:2507.21455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations, and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2 additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8, and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy (4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8). ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance. This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized responses.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense approach against diffusion-based image manipulation. It comprises three novel modules. Firstly, a multi-level deep feature extractor enhances protective effectiveness by extracting intricate features from the diffusion denoising process. Secondly, a multi-scale, semantic-preserving data augmentation technique improves the transferability of adversarial perturbations across different conditions. Thirdly, a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy strengthens protection against manipulations guided by diverse random seeds. Experimental results on InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ demonstrate the effectiveness of Anti-Inpainting in defending against diffusion-based inpainters under unknown conditions. The approach also shows robustness against various image purification methods and transferability across different versions of the diffusion model. <div>

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of diffusion-based malicious image manipulation, existing proactive defense methods struggle to safeguard images against tampering under unknown conditions. To address this, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense approach that achieves protection comprising three novel modules. First, we introduce a multi-level deep feature extractor to obtain intricate features from the diffusion denoising process, enhancing protective effectiveness. Second, we design a multi-scale, semantic-preserving data augmentation technique to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions. Finally, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to bolster protection against manipulations guided by diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments on InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that Anti-Inpainting effectively defends against diffusion-based inpainters under unknown conditions. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robustness against various image purification methods and transferability across different diffusion model versions.

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to generate a fictional Buddhist "sutra"', and offers a detailed analysis of the resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making. We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to adapt.

Summary: 
The study addresses the challenge of comprehension gaps in news content, where audiences may struggle to understand aspects outside their expertise. The MADES framework, utilizing diverse agents with specific knowledge and memory systems, simulates societal communication to identify and address these gaps. Through iterative discussions, the framework detects misunderstandings and designs supplementary material to improve news understanding. Statistical analysis and human evaluation confirm significant improvement in agents' comprehension after receiving this material. Overall, the study presents a promising approach to enhancing audience understanding of comprehensive news content across different domains. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.21055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern news is often comprehensive, weaving together information from diverse domains, including technology, finance, and agriculture. This very comprehensiveness creates a challenge for interpretation, as audiences typically possess specialized knowledge related to their expertise, age, or standpoint. Consequently, a reader might fully understand the financial implications of a story but fail to grasp or even actively misunderstand its legal or technological dimensions, resulting in critical comprehension gaps. In this work, we investigate how to identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences' understanding of news content, particularly in the aspects of articles outside their primary domains of knowledge. We propose MADES, an agent-based framework designed to simulate societal communication. The framework utilizes diverse agents, each configured to represent a specific occupation or age group. Each agent is equipped with a memory system. These agents are then simulated to discuss the news. This process enables us to monitor and analyze their behavior and cognitive processes. Our findings indicate that the framework can identify confusions and misunderstandings within news content through its iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate identifications, the framework then designs supplementary material. We validated these outcomes using both statistical analysis and human evaluation, and the results show that agents exhibit significantly improved news understanding after receiving this supplementary material.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO) framework for improving the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. MaPPO incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective, extending existing methods by utilizing a Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This approach mitigates oversimplified binary classification of responses and requires no additional hyperparameters, supporting both offline and online preference optimization. MaPPO can be applied as a plugin with consistent improvement on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variants like SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Empirical evaluations across different model sizes and benchmarks demonstrate consistent enhancements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency. <div>

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Summary:
Deepfakes, generated using advanced machine learning models, pose a significant threat to identity verification and digital media authenticity. Despite the development of detectors, their efficacy in real-world scenarios remains untested. This study evaluates modern deepfake detectors using a new testing procedure with over 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. The analysis reveals that detecting deepfakes is still a challenging task, with less than half of the detectors achieving an AUC score above 60%, and the lowest scoring at 50%. The study also shows that simple image manipulations like JPEG compression can significantly impact detector performance. The code and data used in the study are publicly available.<br /><br />Summary: Deepfakes, created using advanced machine learning, pose a threat to identity verification and media authenticity.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance.

Summary: 
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are advancing into autonomous agents with the ability to reason, adapt, and act independently. This paper proposes a typology of agentic AI systems that includes eight dimensions defining their cognitive and environmental agency. Through a systematic approach, this typology is developed, refined, and evaluated using a human-AI hybrid method, resulting in constructed types. The framework allows for the analysis of different levels of agency in AI systems, providing a structured perspective on the progression of AI capabilities. It serves as a foundation for evaluating current systems and anticipating future developments in agentic AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments in agentic AI.

arXiv:2508.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of 'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a 'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers (ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration, introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

- Research primarily focuses on TTS in single-stage tasks, while real-world problems often involve multi-stage complex tasks with specific subtask requirements.
- Multi-stage tasks present challenges due to the combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations.
- Optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing complexity of compute-optimal search.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

<div> Keywords: Symbiotic AI, Ethical Risk Assessment, Fuzzy Logic, Analytic Hierarchy Process, Certainty Factors

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called ff4ERA that aims to support ethical decision-making in human-AI collaboration by quantitatively assessing and prioritizing ethical risks. The framework integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, and Certainty Factors to calculate an Ethical Risk Score for each type of risk. Through a case study, it is shown that the framework produces context-sensitive and robust risk scores that align with expert input and sensor-based evidence. Local sensitivity analysis demonstrates predictable behavior across perturbations, while global Sobol analysis highlights the influence of expert-defined weights and certainty factors. Overall, ff4ERA provides interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware ethical assessments, allowing for what-if analyses and assisting designers in calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical decision support. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust. Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise. This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic, step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical decision support.

<div> risk, decision-making, prospect theory, Large Language Models, framing effects
Summary:
- The study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) approach risky decisions using the framework of Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory.
- Context plays a significant role in determining risk appetite, with the language of scenarios influencing decision-making.
- Military scenarios induce greater framing effects on risk assessment compared to civilian settings.
- Language models reflect human heuristics and biases, suggesting that biases are context-dependent.
- Wittgenstein's concept of 'language games' elucidates the localized biases activated by different scenarios.
Summary: The study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) make risky decisions based on prospect theory, showing that context and the framing of scenarios influence risk assessment. Military scenarios evoke stronger framing effects compared to civilian settings, suggesting that biases are contextually dependent. This research highlights that LLMs mirror human decision-making processes and biases, with language playing a crucial role in shaping risk perception. Wittgenstein's idea of 'language games' elucidates the nuanced biases activated in specific scenarios, shedding light on the interplay between language, context, and decision-making in artificial intelligence systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models, including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in LLMs.

<div> Keyword: Large Language Models, Knowledge Editing, Multi-hop Question Answering, Semantic Analysis, Logic Optimization 
Summary:
The paper introduces a new framework called CHECK for updating knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks. Existing knowledge editing approaches have struggled with compositional reasoning tasks due to illogical reasoning processes. CHECK addresses this issue by leveraging semantic analysis inspired by compilers. It analyzes reasoning chains before execution, revising those with semantic errors for consistency through logic optimization. The model is re-prompted at a higher temperature if necessary. Evaluation against five state-of-the-art frameworks on four datasets shows CHECK achieves an average 22.8% improved accuracy in MQA. The framework significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the importance of semantic analysis and logic optimization in updating knowledge within these models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods. AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning, and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference. Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging. Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec, SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/ dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

<div> Keywords: generative AI, tipping instability, multilayer architecture, AI risk, legal liabilities

Summary:
Generative AI, like ChatGPT, can produce repetitive and biased output, with the potential to transition from correct to misleading without user detection. A mathematical model mapping to a multispin thermal system reveals a hidden tipping point at the AI's basic Attention head. A simple formula demonstrates the influence of user prompts and training bias on this tipping instability. The multilayer architecture of AI systems can further amplify output tipping. Understanding these dynamics can enhance AI transparency and performance, while also quantifying users' AI risk and legal responsibilities. This research sheds light on the complexities of AI behavior and the implications for users and legal frameworks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good (correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024 alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths. Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency, explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users' AI risk and legal liabilities.

<div> Keywords: socio-economic indicators, satellite imagery, Internet-sourced text, wealth prediction, multimodal dataset

Summary: 
We investigate the use of socio-economic indicators on satellite imagery and web-sourced text data to predict household wealth in African neighborhoods. By combining vision models with AI-generated text and web data, our multimodal framework outperforms vision-only methods in wealth prediction. We find that there is partial convergence between visual and text representations, indicating a shared latent code of material well-being. We release a large-scale dataset comprising DHS clusters, satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts for further research. This study suggests that a combination of visual and textual data can enhance wealth prediction accuracy, with potential implications for understanding socio-economic patterns in diverse communities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

<div> Keywords: Deep learning, Trajectory prediction, Autonomous driving, Continual learning, Memory replay<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new continual learning method, H2C, inspired by the hippocampal circuit, to address catastrophic forgetting in trajectory prediction for autonomous driving systems. This method aims to retain prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. Two strategies are developed to select samples that represent distinctive and overall knowledge. The H2C method updates using a memory replay loss function calculated based on these selected samples. Experiments on the INTERACTION dataset show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting by 22.71% on average compared to DL baselines. The approach is task-free and does not rely on manually informed distributional shifts, making it suitable for real-world applications involving dynamic distributions. The code implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD). However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts. The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

<div> Benchmark, Emotion conflicts, Multimodal Large Language Models, MoSEAR, Modality integration<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a new benchmark called CA-MER to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in scenarios involving emotion conflicts. Current MLLMs tend to rely heavily on audio signals during conflicts, neglecting visual cues. To address this bias, a new framework called MoSEAR is proposed, comprising MoSE for modality-specific experts and AR for attention reallocation. MoSEAR effectively balances modality integration, mitigates emotion conflicts, and improves performance on consistent samples without compromising audio-visual modality balance. Experimental results on various benchmarks, including MER2023 and EMER, show that MoSEAR outperforms existing methods, especially in modality conflict conditions. <div>
arXiv:2508.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration, external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles, orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20 representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow infrastructure, and safe automation.

Summary:
- The study explores Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and its limitations when pushed beyond training data distributions.
- CoT prompting has been shown to improve LLM performance by mimicking human-like reasoning steps, but the effectiveness is constrained by distribution discrepancies.
- The research dissects CoT reasoning through three dimensions: task, length, and format, using the DataAlchemy environment for controlled experiments.
- Results indicate that CoT reasoning is a fragile illusion that disappears when faced with unfamiliar distribution conditions.
- The findings highlight the challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning in language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Summary:
The article introduces BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation framework for assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on code generation tasks without requiring ground-truth execution of the generated code. BIS uses importance sampling theory and Importance Weighted Autoencoders to estimate performance metrics by analyzing prompt distributions. It reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks to predict performance on new, unseen benchmarks and introduces weight truncation strategies for stabilization. BIS serves as a cost-effective tool for benchmark development and validation, providing quick feedback on prompt selection and contamination assessment. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks show BIS achieves an average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with good generalization to other metrics like pass@1. The framework demonstrates reliability, broad applicability, and potential to reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in code-related tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation, we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources, offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1. These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in code-related tasks.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel fault detection method that combines significance testing with the conformal prediction framework to enhance safety and reliability in industrial systems. By using a nonconformity measure based on model residuals and a calibration dataset, the method computes p-values for new samples to create prediction sets with guaranteed probabilities. These prediction sets aid in fault classification by analyzing intersections with normal and fault label sets. Experimental results validate the method's theoretical properties, showing consistent coverage rates and a controllable trade-off between risk level and efficiency. The approach provides formal risk guarantees, enabling trustworthiness in safety-critical applications and advancing diagnostic systems to produce uncertainty-aware outputs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$) and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative, uncertainty-aware outputs.

Summary:
SketchAgent is a multi-agent system that automates the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams by integrating sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation. The system aims to streamline the diagram generation process, reducing the need for manual effort and bridging the gap between intuitive sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark dataset and evaluation framework were created, consisting of over 6,000 high-quality examples across eight diagram categories. This benchmark offers token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous quality control. By enhancing the efficiency of translating freehand sketches into machine-readable diagrams, SketchAgent has potential applications in design, education, and engineering.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering, while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DiagramAgent/Sketch2Diagram-Benchmark.

Summary: 
The study introduces MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combining Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. It addresses the trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through fine-grained expert routing, shared expert isolation, and gradient-conflict-free load balancing. Experiments show that with a compression ratio of r=d/2, the model achieves significant memory reduction and speedup in inference while maintaining competitive perplexity. Compared to vanilla transformers, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves validation loss by 6.9% using 42% fewer active parameters per pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal an 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation with GPT-4 confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores in coherence, creativity, and grammatical correctness. The study demonstrates that architectural innovation, rather than parameter scaling, is crucial for efficient language model deployment under resource constraints. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with 64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6 of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10), creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models (LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore, their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR metrics, especially on smaller models.

<div> Keywords: knowledge conflicts, long-context scenarios, Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR), Reinforcement Learning, logical consistency

Summary:
The article introduces the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework to address inter-context knowledge conflicts that arise due to conflicting and lengthy contexts in LLMs. KCR enhances the ability of LLMs by training them to follow correct reasoning paths when faced with conflicting information. By extracting reasoning paths from conflicting long contexts and using Reinforcement Learning to reward models for selecting context with stronger logical consistency, KCR enables backbone models to effectively resolve knowledge conflicts. Experimental results show significant improvement in resolving conflicts within long contexts. Overall, the KCR framework provides a systematic approach for LLMs to navigate and resolve knowledge conflicts, leading to substantial performance gains in resolving inter-context conflicts.

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Summary:
The article introduces Multi-TW, a benchmark for evaluating performance and latency of multimodal models in Traditional Chinese. It includes 900 multiple-choice questions from official proficiency tests. Closed-source models generally outperform open-source models, while open-source models show promise in audio tasks. End-to-end any-to-any pipelines offer lower latency compared to vision-language models using separate audio transcription. The results highlight the importance of fine-tuning models for Traditional Chinese and efficient multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However, existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW, the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities, although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and efficient multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

<div> Large Language Models, AI planning, NLP evaluation, recovery pipeline, symbolic planner <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper discusses the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into AI planning tasks and proposes a recovery pipeline for improving the reliability of LLM-generated plans. The pipeline involves an NLP-based evaluation of plans, NLP manipulation to recover plans, and completion using a symbolic planner. The study reveals that LLM-generated plans often contain errors or irrelevant actions, indicating a lack of underlying reasoning. The pipeline enhances plan quality, but the overall success rate is still relatively low. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of a plan are executable, with symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions long. The findings suggest that while the pipeline improves action quality, it does not yet match the reliability of traditional planners. <div>

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

<div> keyword: large language models, jailbreak attacks, PUZZLED, reasoning capabilities, attack success rate
Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but their safety is a growing concern. Existing jailbreak attacks involve prompt engineering or semantic transformations. A new method, PUZZLED, uses word puzzles to mask harmful instructions for LLMs to solve. Three puzzle types - word search, anagram, and crossword - challenge LLM reasoning. PUZZLED achieved a high attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8% on five LLMs, with rates of 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. PUZZLED is a powerful and simple attack strategy that exploits LLM reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response, studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

<div> Equilibrium, task delegation, automation, human-AI teaming, AI governance<br />
Summary:<br />
The study examines the reallocation of tasks between humans and AI systems, proposing an iterated task-delegation map that converges to a stable equilibrium where tasks are performed by the agent with enduring comparative advantage. Using fixed-point tools, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium are proven under certain conditions. A continuous model shows that automation increases as per the pace of automation and the rate of new human-centric tasks, with a projected rise to approximately 65% by 2045. The remaining one-third of tasks are envisioned for humans as a new profession of workflow conductor. The study emphasizes the importance of promoting human-AI teaming to maximize welfare and discusses implications for skill development, benchmark design, and AI governance to steer the economy towards the welfare-maximizing fixed point. <div>
arXiv:2508.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii) derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and $\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the welfare-maximising fixed point.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.

Summary:
The article introduces a road-node-centric framework for next-step location prediction in human mobility, allowing for more flexible choices beyond predefined points of interest (POIs). It incorporates a sector-wise directional POI aggregation to capture environmental context efficiently. The model includes structural graph embeddings to generate semantically grounded node representations. For sequence modeling, a hybrid Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer is used to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies effectively. The model outperforms existing baselines significantly in accuracy and maintains resilience against noise perturbations and POI inaccuracies. <div>

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph, thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17 percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data, failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor, a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over 500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance. Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while generating practical itineraries.

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why their integration is beneficial.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by electric vehicles (EVs) in urban distribution due to their limited battery capacity and the need for careful planning for recharging. The proposed framework, CARGO, addresses the EV-based delivery route planning problem by optimizing route planning and charging for deliveries within time windows. The problem's NP-hardness is proven, and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a computationally efficient heuristic method are proposed. Real-world datasets are used to evaluate the methods, showing up to 39% and 22% reductions in charging cost compared to baseline strategies. The heuristic method outperforms other baseline strategies, such as Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Nearest Delivery First (NDF), while completing comparable deliveries. <div>

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point (CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable deliveries.

The article introduces kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG) as a solution to improving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms by refining kinodynamically feasible plans for large groups of agents. The proposed Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG) framework enhances MAPF plan execution by dynamically adjusting plans based on real-time agent information, reducing uncertainty and preserving collision-freeness. WinkTPG can generate speed profiles for 1,000 agents within 1 second and outperforms existing MAPF execution methods by up to 51.7% in solution quality. This advancement in MAPF algorithms addresses real-world applications where agents need to follow optimized paths while avoiding collisions, making it a significant contribution to the field of multi-agent planning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Dataset Quality, Automated Iterative Approach, Preference-based Fine-tuning, Performance Gains

Summary:
Refine-n-Judge introduces an automated iterative approach using a single large language model (LLM) to refine and evaluate dataset quality. This method leverages the LLM to generate improvements in responses and assess their quality, without requiring human annotation or a separate reward model. The process continues until the LLM no longer prefers the refined answer, resulting in preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning. The approach was effective across various public datasets, showing performance gains and preference of LLM judges for models fine-tuned using the Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets over those tuned on the original datasets by GPT-4. This method demonstrates the scalability of model improvements and the production of high-quality datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach using a single LLM to enhance dataset quality through refinement and evaluation. The method, without requiring human intervention, results in preference-labeled responses suitable for fine-tuning and shows performance gains across diverse datasets. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

<div> investment task, large language models, cognitive biases, escalation of commitment, decision-making 

Summary: 
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in decision-making but may inherit cognitive biases from human-generated data.
- LLM bias manifestation depends on social and organizational context.
- In individual decision-making, LLMs show rational logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
- Multi-agent deliberation reveals a hierarchy effect, with asymmetrical hierarchies showing moderate escalation rates while peer-based decision-making results in near-universal escalation.
- In compound organizational and personal pressures, LLMs exhibit high escalation of commitment, allocating a high percentage to failing divisions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment, where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500 trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment. However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3, N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates (46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions). These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs), especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition, integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline prospective pipelines.

Summary:
GenZ-LTL introduces a method for zero-shot generalization to arbitrary Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications in reinforcement learning. The method decomposes LTL task specifications into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals based on the structure of Büchi automata. By solving reach-avoid problems one subgoal at a time, GenZ-LTL achieves effective zero-shot generalization. The method also employs a subgoal-induced observation reduction technique to address the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations. Empirical results demonstrate that GenZ-LTL significantly outperforms existing methods in handling complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints specified in LTL. <div>
arXiv:2508.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Summary:
The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and mathematical theories to create adaptive AI agents for dynamic environments. Unlike traditional agent architectures, PCF allows real-time parameter adjustments using combinatorial spaces, enabling agents to adapt their behaviors on the fly. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space to capture agent behaviors. By leveraging LLMs, PCF can estimate likely parameter values and variabilities, facilitating the design of optimized agent configurations. Through simulations in mock caf\'e domains of varying complexity levels, PCF identified trends in agent adaptability and performance, emphasizing the importance of scalable designs at higher complexity levels. This framework supports the development of dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in fields such as customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, leading to the creation of adaptable next-generation polymorphic agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments. Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches, Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over 1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research, enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry, bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields. QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, GraphRAG, Temporal dynamics, Temporal reasoning

Summary:
Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG) is introduced as a dynamic, temporally-aware framework for enhancing retrieval augmented generation models. T-GRAG addresses the limitations of existing GraphRAG methods by incorporating temporal knowledge evolution into the retrieval process. Five key components of T-GRAG are outlined: a Temporal Knowledge Graph Generator, Temporal Query Decomposition mechanism, Three-layer Interactive Retriever, Source Text Extractor, and LLM-based Generator. A new benchmark dataset, Time-LongQA, based on corporate annual reports, is introduced to evaluate temporal reasoning in long-text question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GRAG outperforms previous RAG and GraphRAG models in retrieval accuracy and response relevance under temporal constraints, emphasizing the importance of modeling knowledge evolution for robust question answering tasks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic, temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge. Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly available on the T-GRAG

Summary:<br />
Automated medical report generation (MRG) faces challenges due to visual, label distribution, and contextual uncertainty. SURE-Med is proposed as a solution, addressing these uncertainties to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of MRG systems. The framework includes a Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling module to correct view annotation errors and select informative features. A Token Sensitive Learning objective enhances sensitivity to rare conditions by reweighting underrepresented diagnostic terms. The Contextual Evidence Filter validates and incorporates relevant prior information to reduce factual hallucinations. Experimental results on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets show that SURE-Med outperforms existing methods, setting a new benchmark for reliability in medical report generation and enhancing clinical decision support. <div>
arXiv:2508.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty, caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction. Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions. Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports, often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical decision support.

arXiv:2508.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing insightful reasoning steps to users.

Summary: <br />
Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is a challenging problem that traditional methods struggle to solve efficiently. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising solution, but they face pitfalls such as underutilization of data and myopic decision-making. To overcome these challenges, the ReflecSched framework is proposed, which combines LLMs with heuristic-driven simulations to improve decision-making. ReflecSched outperforms direct LLM baselines and individual heuristics, showcasing a Win Rate of 71.35% and a reduction in Relative Percentage Deviation. It also competes with tailored heuristics on all problem cases. By distilling strategic experiences into natural-language summaries, ReflecSched guides the decision-making process to make more informed, non-myopic choices. Overall, ReflecSched offers a strategic analysis capability that enhances the performance of LLMs in solving DFJSP efficiently. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

<div> Bayesian reasoning, information entropy, hypotheses generation, evidence validation, hypotheses refinement
Summary:
The paper introduces a collaborative framework called HypoAgents that integrates Bayesian reasoning and information entropy-driven search across three stages: hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and hypotheses refinement. The framework generates initial hypotheses based on a novelty-relevance-feasibility score and updates their probabilities using external literature evidence and Bayes' theorem. It then identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information entropy and actively refines them through iterative optimization. Experiment results on a real-world research question dataset show significant improvements in the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses. After 12 optimization iterations, average ELO score of hypotheses improved by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8. The framework also significantly reduced overall uncertainty as measured by Shannon entropy by 0.92, demonstrating its effectiveness in automated scientific discovery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes' theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12 optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Summary: 
This article introduces a modeling approach for scheduling problems using conditional time intervals and cumulative functions, commonly used in commercial constraint programming solvers. The implementation utilizes a generic global constraint called the Generalized Cumulative and a novel time-table filtering algorithm to handle tasks on conditional time intervals. Experimental results show competitive performance with existing solvers, enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems. The approach effectively scales to large problems, providing a practical solution for scheduling tasks with complex dependencies. <div>
arXiv:2508.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers. However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and effectively scales to large problems.

<div> Keywords: reasoning systems, formal framework, inference architectures, failure modes, dynamic behaviors <br />
<br />
Summary: This paper presents a formal framework for reasoning systems, aiming to provide a basis for analyzing inference architectures across different domains. Reasoning systems are modeled as structured tuples consisting of phenomena, explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The framework can accommodate various reasoning processes, such as logical, algorithmic, and learning-based, without being tied to a specific algorithm or logic system. Internal criteria like coherence, soundness, and completeness are surveyed, along with potential failure modes like contradiction and non-convergence. The framework also allows for dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle evolution. The goal is to establish a foundational structure for representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where issues like failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may occur. While no specific solution architecture is proposed, the framework aims to support future theoretical and practical research on reasoning under structural constraints. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems, intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains. We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena, explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Process-level Reward Models, uncertainty-driven framework, mathematical reasoning, data construction

Summary:
Large language models have shown impressive capabilities in complex mathematical reasoning tasks, yet they often generate errors in multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) offer a solution by providing supervision at each intermediate step, improving reasoning abilities. However, constructing high-quality process reward data for training PRMs is labor-intensive and inefficient. This paper introduces an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction, enhancing data generation and annotation processes for PRMs. The study also presents two uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods, Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which combine majority vote with PRMs' strengths. Through experiments on various datasets, including ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus, the proposed framework proves effective in enhancing mathematical reasoning abilities in PRMs. The code and data are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/UnPRM.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step, thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/UnPRM.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and 527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model (Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

<title>CloudAnoAgent: Anomaly Detection for Cloud Sites via LLM Agent with Neuro-Symbolic Mechanism</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01844</link>

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

<title>ProKG-Dial: Progressive Multi-Turn Dialogue Construction with Domain Knowledge Graphs</title>

arXiv:2508.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships, providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues. Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity, semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance, highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

<title>Multi-turn Natural Language to Graph Query Language Translation</title>

arXiv:2508.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future research.

<title>Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction</title>

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance. Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in 147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for clinical deployment.

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter (ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

<title>TRACEALIGN -- Tracing the Drift: Attributing Alignment Failures to Training-Time Belief Sources in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02063</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02063</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure, little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO, and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB) while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source our implementation at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tracealign-2DA7

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement, enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and technical support for hazard detection.

<title>Everyone Contributes! Incentivizing Strategic Cooperation in Multi-LLM Systems via Sequential Public Goods Games</title>

arXiv:2508.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel, game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward, effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

<title>SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements, capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both stability and visual resemblance.

<title>Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools</title>

arXiv:2508.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface, highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond prompt-level defenses.

<title>Don't Overthink It: A Survey of Efficient R1-style Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically, when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2) Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention. However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity, hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed. Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse. To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and resolution.

<title>Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention</title>

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational complexity of important information while retaining complete information, achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings. Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods. Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability effectively.

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology, often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics. Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g., health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for games.

<title>Beyond the Trade-off: Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Models' Instruction Following</title>

Abstract: Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving but exhibit a concerning trade off between reasoning capabilities and instruction following abilities. Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger external models, creating methodological bottlenecks and practical limitations including increased costs and accessibility constraints. We propose a self-supervised RL framework that leverages reasoning models' own internal signals to improve instruction following capabilities without external supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves instruction following capabilities while maintaining reasoning performance, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to enhance instruction following in reasoning models. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Rainier-rq/verl-if.

<title>Reconsidering Overthinking: Penalizing Internal and External Redundancy in CoT Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially, we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable LRMs.

<title>Neuromorphic Computing with Multi-Frequency Oscillations: A Bio-Inspired Approach to Artificial Intelligence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02191</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with 2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by 48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns. Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence.

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking. This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations, providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Financial AI holds great promise for transforming modern finance, with the potential to support a wide range of tasks such as market forecasting, portfolio management, quantitative trading, and automated analysis. However, existing platforms remain limited in task coverage, lack robust multimodal data integration, and offer insufficient support for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). In response to these limitations, we present FinWorld, an all-in-one open-source platform that provides end-to-end support for the entire financial AI workflow, from data acquisition to experimentation and deployment. FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment. Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800 million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation for future research and real-world applications. Code is available at Github~\footnote{https://github.com/DVampire/FinWorld}.

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex AI tasks by decomposing them into sub-tasks and solving each sub-task using ready-to-use well-trained models. However, systematically evaluating methods under this setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CABENCH, the first public benchmark comprising 70 realistic composable AI tasks, along with a curated pool of 700 models across multiple modalities and domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating effective execution pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text, video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However, practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs' affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles, and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks, including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks. PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to 92\% on the most complex problems.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician (\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance, but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia, animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air, water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe negative impact on communities.

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless, diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO (Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations, thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks, D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However, scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset, and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

<title>Towards Actionable Pedagogical Feedback: A Multi-Perspective Analysis of Mathematics Teaching and Tutoring Dialogue</title>

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with 43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments. Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles of both educators and students.

<title>Zero-Shot Temporal Interaction Localization for Egocentric Videos</title>

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Abstract: Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives aim to enhance transparency and public participation by making government data openly accessible. However, structuring legal norms for machine readability remains a critical challenge for advancing Legal Tech applications such as Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs). Focusing on the Normas.leg.br portal initiative by the Brazilian National Congress, we propose a unified mapping of Brazilian legislation to the schema.org/Legislation vocabulary via JSON-LD and Linked Data. Our approach covers both the conceptual "Norm" entity (mapped to sdo:Legislation) and its digital publications or manifestations (mapped to sdo:LegislationObject). We detail key properties for each type, providing concrete examples and considering URN identifiers (per the LexML standard), multilingual support, versioning in the Official Journal, and inter-norm relationships (e.g., citations and references). Our structured schema improves the quality and interoperability of Brazilian legal data, fosters integration within the global OGD ecosystem, and facilitates the creation of a wor

Abstract: We introduce Bike-Bench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI capabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives and constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics, structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation results, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a synthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric, CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to evaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular generative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented generative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting significant room for improvement. We hope Bike-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained multi-objective engineering design problems. Code, data, and other resources are published at decode.mit.edu/projects/bikebench/.

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data cleaning stage.

<title>The Attribution Crisis in LLM Search Results</title>

Abstract: Web-enabled LLMs frequently answer queries without crediting the web pages they consume, creating an "attribution gap" - the difference between relevant URLs read and those actually cited. Drawing on approximately 14,000 real-world LMArena conversation logs with search-enabled LLM systems, we document three exploitation patterns: 1) No Search: 34% of Google Gemini and 24% of OpenAI GPT-4o responses are generated without explicitly fetching any online content; 2) No citation: Gemini provides no clickable citation source in 92% of answers; 3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3 relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited - varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries, underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

This development has created new challenges for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest developments in the field, with a focus on deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and twin networks (Siamese networks), which have played a pivotal role in improving the accuracy of covering face recognition. The paper discusses the most prominent challenges, which include changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research trends such as developing more efficient algorithms and integrating multimedia technologies to improve the performance of recognition systems in real-world environments and expand their applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation. This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows while identifying critical areas for future development.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears? Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry, economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic, multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes, learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity), uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

Abstract: In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result, tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting to automate or replace human ethical oversight.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification, environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Abstract: In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into not only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation. This chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science, by focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as fundamentally tied to the global movement of scientific and technological knowledge. With a focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents, and international competition with patents, this work considers how new technologies are challenging traditional notions of inventorship, access, and moral accountability.The chapter provides a critical analysis of AI's implications for patent authorship and prior art searches, ownership issues arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology to ethical dilemmas, and the problem of using patents for strategic advantage in a global context of innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified the importance of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality, implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical contemplation about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems. Ultimately, the chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and ethically-based approach in managing knowledge in the patenting environment highlighting the role for information professionals and policy to contribute to access equity in innovation.

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas, continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected vehicles and trains.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non - replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality \textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm. Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm. Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact center conversations.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a self-supervised scan-specific deep learning framework for reconstructing accelerated multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI).
  Methods: We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain data.
  Results: Under 4x and 5x accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction efficiency by approximately fivefold.
  Conclusion: REFINE-MORE enables accurate and efficient scan-specific multiparametric qMRI reconstruction, providing a flexible solution for high-dimensional, accelerated qMRI applications.

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However, many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions, and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision, enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4% (real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for precision harvesting.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions, measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

<title>Predictive Auditing of Hidden Tokens in LLM APIs via Reasoning Length Estimation</title>

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing, yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g., hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing, offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user trust.

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science, supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online repository.

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2. Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate (e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates: Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains, with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes. Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay, which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism. Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and methods without BTMM, respectively.

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8 points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly reducing training time.

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining, making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%, respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy, called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive, proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater energy savings.

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs) can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph (FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

<title>Rethinking Multimodality: Optimizing Multimodal Deep Learning for Biomedical Signal Classification</title>

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal (Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains. Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study. This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic (BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from 75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%. It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to 2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI inference tasks.

<title>Masked Omics Modeling for Multimodal Representation Learning across Histopathology and Molecular Profiles</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS, a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core, MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities, seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred from any subset of modalities, including H&amp;E alone. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology. The code is available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/MORPHEUS

Abstract: This study introduces the AI-Educational Development Loop (AI-EDL), a theory-driven framework that integrates classical learning theories with human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) to support reflective, iterative learning. Implemented in EduAlly, an AI-assisted platform for writing-intensive and feedback-sensitive tasks, the framework emphasizes transparency, self-regulated learning, and pedagogical oversight. A mixed-methods study was piloted at a comprehensive public university to evaluate alignment between AI-generated feedback, instructor evaluations, and student self-assessments; the impact of iterative revision on performance; and student perceptions of AI feedback. Quantitative results demonstrated statistically significant improvement between first and second attempts, with agreement between student self-evaluations and final instructor grades. Qualitative findings indicated students valued immediacy, specificity, and opportunities for growth that AI feedback provided. These findings validate the potential to enhance student learning outcomes through developmentally grounded, ethically aligned, and scalable AI feedback systems. The study concludes with implications for future interdisciplinary applications and refinement of AI-supported educational technologies.

<title>Generative AI as a Geopolitical Factor in Industry 5.0: Sovereignty, Access, and Control</title>

Abstract: Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI) and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine, allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more sophisticated, there is a possibility to harness LLMs to power social media bots. This work investigates the realism of generating LLM-Powered social media bot networks. Through a combination of manual effort, network science and LLMs, we create synthetic bot agent personas, their tweets and their interactions, thereby simulating social media networks. We compare the generated networks against empirical bot/human data, observing that both network and linguistic properties of LLM-Powered Bots differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art: WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho = -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive) high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process (GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies (including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT, Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds, AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of 0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts solving iris PAD visual task.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18 unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow, potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides. Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as practice aids.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at \href{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}.

<title>Managing Escalation in Off-the-Shelf Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models, including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT) familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including escalation management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses. Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct.

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links. Our key innovation is the integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions. Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant configurations, demonstrate that MAAC-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art terrestrial and satellite-assisted baselines by up to 14% in transmission utility and maintains high estimation accuracy across varying vehicle densities and sharing levels.

Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).

Abstract: We explain how data-driven quantization of a linear unit in a neural network corresponds to solving the closest vector problem for a certain lattice generated by input data. We prove that the GPTQ algorithm is equivalent to Babai's well-known nearest-plane algorithm. We furthermore provide geometric intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis reduction for better quantization.

<title>Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations</title>

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG). Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs, we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered services toward formally guaranteed security.

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form, optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions, where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance. Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological, academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

<title>Towards Bridging Review Sparsity in Recommendation with Textual Edge Graph Representation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01128</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques -- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines, delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for improved recommendations.

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in safety-critical problem domains.

<title>COLLAGE: Adaptive Fusion-based Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues. COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g., appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks, where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset.

<title>DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&amp;M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&amp;M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&amp;M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&amp;M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using 145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3 achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of real-world physician communication.

Abstract: AI-based voice analysis shows promise for disease diagnostics, but existing classifiers often fail to accurately identify specific pathologies because of gender-related acoustic variations and the scarcity of data for rare diseases. We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC), with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice pathology classification while reducing gender bias through hierarchical modeling of vocal characteristics.

<title>RSPO: Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization for Pass@k and Max@k Metrics in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the "hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations, resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.

<title>Adaptive Content Restriction for Large Language Models via Suffix Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction} (AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named \textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches, including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark} (CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8 carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols, packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication (MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%. This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to evaluating the pavement network in the future.

<title>Oldie but Goodie: Re-illuminating Label Propagation on Graphs with Partially Observed Features</title>

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed. In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation (Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention. Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few features are available but also in abundantly available situations.

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex, multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding, repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful LLM-based data science.

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable. In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison (NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

<title>Exploitation Is All You Need... for Exploration</title>

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments. Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1) Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data; and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2). Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

<title>CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

<title>GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models (LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates $\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T $\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms, such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex, as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives, will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$ better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction. In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics, achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory speed.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL) has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper, we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations. Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads, where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: With increasing demand for ride comfort in new energy vehicles, accurate real-time detection of speed bumps and potholes is critical for predictive suspension control. This paper proposes SBP-YOLO, a lightweight detection framework based on YOLOv11, optimized for embedded deployment. The model integrates GhostConv for efficient computation, VoVGSCSPC for multi-scale feature enhancement, and a Lightweight Efficiency Detection Head (LEDH) to reduce early-stage feature processing costs. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based weather augmentation improves detection robustness, especially for small and distant targets. Experiments show SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP (outperforming YOLOv11n by 5.8%) and runs at 139.5 FPS on a Jetson AGX Xavier with TensorRT FP16 quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real-time road condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS). Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model. These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using LLMs for Automated Exploit Generation (AEG) against vulnerable smart contracts. We present \textsc{ReX}, a framework integrating LLM-based exploit synthesis with the Foundry testing suite, enabling the automated generation and validation of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We further analyze factors influencing AEG effectiveness, including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support future research.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

<title>A Full-Stage Refined Proposal Algorithm for Suppressing False Positives in Two-Stage CNN-Based Detection Methods</title>

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression. During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores, filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model, supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints, occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery. This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of 91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

<title>Recognising, Anticipating, and Mitigating LLM Pollution of Online Behavioural Research</title>

Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research.

<title>Via Score to Performance: Efficient Human-Controllable Long Song Generation with Bar-Level Symbolic Notation</title>

Abstract: Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC; nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation. Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its superiority across multiple subjective metrics.

<title>Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image</title>

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data (unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Physicians spend significant time documenting clinical encounters, a burden that contributes to professional burnout. To address this, robust automation tools for medical documentation are crucial. We introduce MedSynth -- a novel dataset of synthetic medical dialogues and notes designed to advance the Dialogue-to-Note (Dial-2-Note) and Note-to-Dialogue (Note-2-Dial) tasks. Informed by an extensive analysis of disease distributions, this dataset includes over 10,000 dialogue-note pairs covering over 2000 ICD-10 codes. We demonstrate that our dataset markedly enhances the performance of models in generating medical notes from dialogues, and dialogues from medical notes. The dataset provides a valuable resource in a field where open-access, privacy-compliant, and diverse training data are scarce.

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory, long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks. RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical robots.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/NiceRingNode/SPECTRUM.

<title>Tuning LLM-based Code Optimization via Meta-Prompting: An Industrial Perspective</title>

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting, and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters, providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

<title>Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics</title>

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x 10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations $\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection $\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

Abstract: Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22 shrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone equal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to account for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars that govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic pitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two critical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and (2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs complementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state transducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti framework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that incorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions. Comprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that ShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for correction tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at corruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under pitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas (90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical music expression.

<title>FlashSVD: Memory-Efficient Inference with Streaming for Low-Rank Models</title>

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension, prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world, on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models. FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

<title>The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations</title>

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness. Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is $O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural ODEs.

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection (MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability. Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even against unseen generators like Sora.

<title>Revisiting Gossip Protocols: A Vision for Emergent Coordination in Agentic Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination. Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness, and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient, reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life. However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than 100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training. This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run directly on smartphones.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies, has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities. Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity challenges.

Abstract: This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in data visualization knowledge tasks. Through systematic comparative analysis of responses to visualization questions, we find that differences exist between two ChatGPT models and human outputs over rhetorical structure, knowledge breadth, and perceptual quality. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT-4, as a more advanced model, displays a hybrid of characteristics from both humans and ChatGPT-3.5. The two models were generally favored over human responses, while their strengths in coverage and breadth, and emphasis on technical and task-oriented visualization feedback collectively shaped higher overall quality. Based on our findings, we draw implications for advancing user experiences based on the potential of LLMs and human perception over their capabilities, with relevance to broader applications of AI.

<title>Are All Prompt Components Value-Neutral? Understanding the Heterogeneous Adversarial Robustness of Dissected Prompt in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb. To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

<title>Deeply Supervised Multi-Task Autoencoder for Biological Brain Age estimation using three dimensional T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging</title>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D) T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark (OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups. Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of the overall architecture.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in recent years has catalyzed transformative advances in wireless communications and networks. Among the members of the GenAI family, Diffusion Models (DMs) have risen to prominence as a powerful option, capable of handling complex, high-dimensional data distribution, as well as consistent, noise-robust performance. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications of DMs across future communication systems. We first provide an extensive tutorial of DMs and demonstrate how they can be applied to enhance optimizers, reinforcement learning and incentive mechanisms, which are popular approaches for problems in wireless networks. Then, we review and discuss the DM-based methods proposed for emerging issues in future networks and communications, including channel modeling and estimation, signal detection and data reconstruction, integrated sensing and communication, resource management in edge computing networks, semantic communications and other notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling, our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator, guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy generative design.

arXiv:2508.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results. Code will be available.

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts. Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially, collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model, identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere. The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs) remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data, formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking. Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate, while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore, we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced, publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes (PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12 established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act.

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management. Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Semantic Encryption: Secure and Effective Interaction with Cloud-based Large Language Models via Semantic Transformation</title>

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions. While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information, they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information. This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

<title>DRKF: Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However, inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues. We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency and accuracy.

<title>DUP: Detection-guided Unlearning for Backdoor Purification in Language Models</title>

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy. Our code is available at https://github.com/ManHu2025/DUP.

<title>MAP: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Map-Level Attention Processing</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of the map-level decoding strategy.

<title>Authorship Attribution in Multilingual Machine-Generated Texts</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA), i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages -- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

<title>CUPID: Evaluating Personalized and Contextualized Alignment of LLMs from Interactions</title>

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance, increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly. Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<title>From SHAP to Rules: Distilling Expert Knowledge from Post-hoc Model Explanations in Time Series Classification</title>

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification is challenging due to inherent difficulty in raw time series interpretation and doubled down by the high dimensionality. We propose a framework that converts numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define intervals indicating when and where they apply, improving transparency. Our approach performs comparably to native rule-based methods like Anchor while scaling better to long TS and covering more instances. Rule fusion integrates rule sets through methods such as weighted selection and lasso-based refinement to balance coverage, confidence, and simplicity, ensuring all instances receive an unambiguous, metric-optimized rule. It enhances explanations even for a single explainer. We introduce visualization techniques to manage specificity-generalization trade-offs. By aligning with expert-system principles, our framework consolidates conflicting or overlapping explanations - often resulting from the Rashomon effect - into coherent and domain-adaptable insights. Experiments on UCI datasets confirm that the resulting rule-based representations improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras, limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance, achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of 0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and robust HAR systems.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID, a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and (ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting, Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound, concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification models.

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies, where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1) underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2) neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns. Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation, Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with 50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth} the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach. Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from 124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA, CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C, convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters. Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH segmentation.

<title>VAGPO: Vision-augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization for the Routing Problems</title>

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation, ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes, categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical applications.

<title>RouteMark: A Fingerprint for Intellectual Property Attribution in Routing-based Model Merging</title>

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed, centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline, and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in keypoint-based CSLR.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and advancing structure-based drug design.

<title>Mitigating Persistent Client Dropout in Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies, disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ (Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM) are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains such as the circular economy, where information about classifications, processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval, query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition, we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition. Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling accelerated materials design and composition optimization.

<title>Neural Predictive Control to Coordinate Discrete- and Continuous-Time Models for Time-Series Analysis with Control-Theoretical Improvements</title>

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis, such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation, extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and (2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics. During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy, evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

Abstract: Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments, raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion, privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of 89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies. Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio. These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods, while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems (RRS) in dating, gaming, and talent platforms require mutual acceptance for a match. Logged data, however, over-represents popular profiles due to past exposure policies, creating feedback loops that skew learning and fairness. We introduce Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender Systems (CFRR), a causal framework to mitigate this bias. CFRR uses inverse propensity scored, self-normalized objectives. Experiments show CFRR improves NDCG@10 by up to 3.5% (e.g., from 0.459 to 0.475 on DBLP, from 0.299 to 0.307 on Synthetic), increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51% (from 0.504 to 0.763 on Synthetic), and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24% (from 0.708 to 0.535 on Synthetic). CFRR offers a promising approach for more accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4) % accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4 $\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity. Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation. However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e., the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states), emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the "Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our findings on steerability dynamics.

<title>Revisiting Replay and Gradient Alignment for Continual Pre-Training of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100 billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of replaying old examples.

<title>Decomposing Representation Space into Interpretable Subspaces with Unsupervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way? Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to ``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing. Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding model internals and building circuits.

<title>L3M+P: Lifelong Planning with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs), recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches, PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall, we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable, reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally, we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images, setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve" and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization. We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural transparency in alignment research.

<title>Proactive Disentangled Modeling of Trigger-Object Pairings for Backdoor Defense</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training pipelines.

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

<title>ROVER: Recursive Reasoning Over Videos with Vision-Language Models for Embodied Tasks</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

<title>Inferring Reward Machines and Transition Machines from Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations. Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata. Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A \otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an 840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a 5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a 3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy, Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression, quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis, Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$ reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Building on this dataset, we develop the Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT, Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance, comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a significant step toward inclusive AI by enabling high-quality Tibetan language processing through both resource creation and model innovation.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms, but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users. Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that, compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems, enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies, and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models. SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval, procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to 65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance, medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations. Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future epidemic containment.

<title>Enhancement of Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning via Improved Laplacian and Poisson Methods</title>

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained by label availability and hardware limitations.

<title>RICL: Adding In-Context Adaptability to Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments. However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning. Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20 demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning interface for new manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL), a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation. Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance. Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source our implementation.

Abstract: Advanced bioimaging technologies have enabled the large-scale acquisition of multidimensional data, yet effective metadata management and interoperability remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose a new ontology-driven framework for the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics Database (SSBD) that adopts a two-tier architecture. The core layer provides a class-centric structure referencing existing biomedical ontologies, supporting both SSBD:repository -- which focuses on rapid dataset publication with minimal metadata -- and SSBD:database, which is enhanced with biological and imaging-related annotations. Meanwhile, the instance layer represents actual imaging dataset information as Resource Description Framework individuals that are explicitly linked to the core classes. This layered approach aligns flexible instance data with robust ontological classes, enabling seamless integration and advanced semantic queries. By coupling flexibility with rigor, the SSBD Ontology promotes interoperability, data reuse, and the discovery of novel biological mechanisms. Moreover, our solution aligns with the Recommended Metadata for Biological Images guidelines and fosters compatibility. Ultimately, our approach contributes to establishing a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data ecosystem within the bioimaging community.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data, and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off: intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$ fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under 10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility, providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23 empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories, including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data) while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The code for our method would be available at https://github.com/still2009/cowardFL.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand. We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events, specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact. We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data. AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of 16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image information.

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are publicly available at \href{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}.

<title>Learning Dynamics of Meta-Learning in Small Model Pretraining</title>

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining, producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications. Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and (iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller, shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and WandB logs are released.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly, leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456 challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false) queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$ LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LeanK.

<title>FinCPRG: A Bidirectional Generation Pipeline for Hierarchical Queries and Rich Relevance in Financial Chinese Passage Retrieval</title>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels, benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training and benchmarking.

<title>Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Confidence-Gated Taylor</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen, a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules. Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions, heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

Abstract: Detecting and segmenting dysfluencies is crucial for effective speech therapy and real-time feedback. However, most methods only classify dysfluencies at the utterance level. We introduce StutterCut, a semi-supervised framework that formulates dysfluency segmentation as a graph partitioning problem, where speech embeddings from overlapping windows are represented as graph nodes. We refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency boundaries for four dysfluency types. This provides a more realistic benchmark compared to synthetic datasets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that StutterCut outperforms existing methods, achieving higher F1 scores and more precise stuttering onset detection.

<title>Decomposing the Entropy-Performance Exchange: The Missing Keys to Unlocking Effective Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/CellForge.

Abstract: This paper proposes to refer to the field of software engineering related to the life cycle of dialogue systems as Dialogue Systems Engineering, and surveys this field while also discussing its future directions. With the advancement of large language models, the core technologies underlying dialogue systems have significantly progressed. As a result, dialogue system technology is now expected to be applied to solving various societal issues and in business contexts. To achieve this, it is important to build, operate, and continuously improve dialogue systems correctly and efficiently. Accordingly, in addition to applying existing software engineering knowledge, it is becoming increasingly important to evolve software engineering tailored specifically to dialogue systems. In this paper, we enumerate the knowledge areas of dialogue systems engineering based on those of software engineering, as defined in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Version 4.0, and survey each area. Based on this survey, we identify unexplored topics in each area and discuss the future direction of dialogue systems engineering.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error, which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally, FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate. Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG) demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning (RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation, and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates, explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward data security in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end omni-modal training. %
We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of new modalities with minimal code change. %
Using \veomni, a omni-modal mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over 2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for training large omni-modal LLMs.

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error. Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX 5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models, MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines.

<title>mmWave Radar-Based Non-Line-of-Sight Pedestrian Localization at T-Junctions Utilizing Road Layout Extraction via Camera</title>

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking face generation.

<title>Inference-time Scaling for Diffusion-based Audio Super-resolution</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, including audio super-resolution (SR). In many applications like movie post-production and album mastering, substantial computational budgets are available for achieving superior audio quality. However, while existing diffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the performance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the sampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs. Here, rather than simply increasing the number of sampling steps, we propose a different paradigm through inference-time scaling for SR, which explores multiple solution trajectories during the sampling process. Different task-specific verifiers are developed, and two search algorithms, including the random search and zero-order search for SR, are introduced. By actively guiding the exploration of the high-dimensional solution space through verifier-algorithm combinations, we enable more robust and higher-quality outputs. Through extensive validation across diverse audio domains (speech, music, sound effects) and frequency ranges, we demonstrate consistent performance gains, achieving improvements of up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88% in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral distance for speech SR from 4kHz to 24kHz, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>CompressKV: Semantic Retrieval Heads Know What Tokens are Not Important Before Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/CompressKV.git.

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images. Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents' returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control, such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control (leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall fairness in agents' returns.

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.

Abstract: This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence, Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary insight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when evaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains.

<title>Dynamic Forgetting and Spatio-Temporal Periodic Interest Modeling for Local-Life Service Recommendation</title>

Abstract: In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM) with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV). In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application scenarios.

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles. In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more responsive developer assistance.

Abstract: While many tools are available for designing AI, non-experts still face challenges in clearly expressing their intent and managing system complexity. We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers and enhances user experience in AI service design.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria. This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer environment.

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors) disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces. We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with AS.

Abstract: Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy, bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational, technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers, frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance; (5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7) philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared, thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set, DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however, existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment. To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes, with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining multiple LLM outputs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

Abstract: Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI (XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes, cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning experiences and competency assessment.

<title>StructSynth: Leveraging LLMs for Structure-Aware Tabular Data Synthesis in Low-Data Regimes</title>

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution, traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data, leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture. First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage}, TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values, class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings, achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools. AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents. However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable, our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40 aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between solution time and optimality.

Abstract: Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.

Abstract: The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text recognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal classification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this paper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new recognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module and global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are split. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate sequential visual features. Finally, by fusing the visual features and the corresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can be obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms, fully-connected layers, recurrent units and convolutional layers are efficiently organized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets (the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset (the IAM) show that the proposed method can achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Wukong90/3DAttention-MultiScaleTraining-for-HTR.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has been a quiet, yet crucial component of many high-profile successes of reinforcement learning. Despite this, it is still a niche topic that is not directly supported by any of the major reinforcement learning libraries. These methods can improve the capabilities and generalization of RL agents, but often require complex changes to training code. We introduce Syllabus, a portable curriculum learning library, as a solution to this problem. Syllabus provides a universal API for curriculum learning, modular implementations of popular automatic curriculum learning methods, and infrastructure that allows them to be easily integrated with asynchronous training code in nearly any RL library. Syllabus provides a minimal API for core curriculum learning components, making it easier to design new algorithms and adapt existing ones to new environments. We demonstrate this by evaluating the algorithms in Syllabus on several new environments, each using agents written in a different RL library. We present the first examples of automatic curriculum learning in NetHack and Neural MMO, two of the most challenging RL benchmarks, and find evidence that existing methods do not directly transfer to complex new environments. Syllabus can be found at https://github.com/RyanNavillus/Syllabus.

The computational complexity and memory usage of the proposed method scale linearly with the number of samples, making it highly attractive for high-dimensional settings. In several examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), a central challenge is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural images. Despite the impressive capabilities of advanced AI generative models in producing visually compelling content, significant discrepancies remain when compared to natural images. To systematically investigate and quantify these differences, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset named DANI, comprising 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AI-generated image (AIGI) samples produced by nine representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, including Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text and Image-to-Image (TI2I). We then introduce D-Judge, a benchmark designed to answer the critical question: how far are AI-generated images from truly realistic images? Our fine-grained evaluation framework assesses DANI across five key dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive experiments reveal substantial discrepancies across these dimensions, highlighting the importance of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI-generated image quality. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/ryliu68/DJudge and https://huggingface.co/datasets/Renyang/DANI.

Abstract: Domain-independent heuristics have long been a cornerstone of AI planning, offering general solutions applicable across a wide range of tasks without requiring domain-specific engineering. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to generate heuristics tailored to specific planning problems, potentially challenging the necessity of domain independence as a strict design principle. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation. We discuss whether these results signify a paradigm shift and how they can complement existing approaches.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.

Abstract: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, paving the way for advanced intelligent agents capable of sophisticated reasoning, robust perception, and versatile action across diverse domains. As these agents increasingly drive AI research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This book provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within modular, brain-inspired architectures that integrate principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected parts. First, we systematically investigate the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities and elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, goal, and emotion. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning through automated optimization paradigms. Third, we examine multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures. Finally, we address the critical imperative of building safe and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment. By synthesizing modular AI architectures with insights from different disciplines, this survey identifies key research challenges and opportunities, encouraging innovations that harmonize technological advancement with meaningful societal benefit.

Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for guaranteeing and evaluating the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in control systems. We introduce "recovery time" as a new metric of resilience in order to quantify the time required for an LSTM to return to its normal state after anomalous inputs. By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications.

Abstract: Wildfires increasingly threaten human life, ecosystems, and infrastructure, with events like the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County underscoring the urgent need for more advanced prediction frameworks. Existing physics-based and deep learning models struggle to capture dynamic wildfire spread across both 2D and 3D domains, especially when incorporating real-time, multimodal geospatial data. This paper explores how generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models-such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers-can serve as transformative tools for wildfire prediction and simulation. These models offer superior capabilities in managing uncertainty, integrating multimodal inputs, and generating realistic, scalable wildfire scenarios. We introduce a new paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) for literature synthesis, classification, and knowledge extraction, conducting a systematic review of recent studies applying generative AI to fire prediction and monitoring. We highlight how generative approaches uniquely address challenges faced by traditional simulation and deep learning methods. Finally, we outline five key future directions for generative AI in wildfire management, including unified multimodal modeling of 2D and 3D dynamics, agentic AI systems and chatbots for decision intelligence, and real-time scenario generation on mobile devices, along with a discussion of critical challenges. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift toward multimodal generative frameworks to support proactive, data-informed wildfire response.

<title>FloorplanMAE:A self-supervised framework for complete floorplan generation from partial inputs</title>

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process. Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs, improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones. First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet, specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad application prospects.

<title>A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI</title>

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Verifying the complex and multi-step reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge, as holistic methods often overlook localized flaws. Step-by-step validation is a promising alternative, yet existing methods are often rigid. They struggle to adapt to diverse reasoning structures, from formal proofs to informal natural language narratives. To address this adaptability gap, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV), a novel framework for adaptable and multi-granular verification. GoV's core innovation is its flexible "node block" architecture. This mechanism allows GoV to adaptively adjust its verification granularity--from atomic steps for formal tasks to entire paragraphs for natural language--to match the native structure of the reasoning process. This flexibility allows GoV to resolve the fundamental trade-off between verification precision and robustness. Experiments on both well-structured and loosely-structured benchmarks demonstrate GoV's versatility. The results show that GoV's adaptive approach significantly outperforms both holistic baselines and other state-of-the-art decomposition-based methods, establishing a new standard for training-free reasoning verification.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative impact on science, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited in enabling genuine scientific discovery. This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually reinforcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and empirical grounding. Central to addressing these gaps is recognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative hypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws can be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast, deterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test consistency with known principles. Abstractions in this loop should be manipulable models that enable counterfactual prediction, causal attribution, and refinement. Design principles -- rather than a monolithic recipe -- are proposed for systems that reason in imaginary spaces and learn from the world: causal, multimodal models for internal simulation; persistent, uncertainty-aware scientific memory that distinguishes hypotheses from established claims; formal verification pathways coupled to computations and experiments. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties make human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component. Evaluations must assess the system's ability to identify novel phenomena, propose falsifiable hypotheses, and efficiently guide experimental programs toward genuine discoveries.

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

Abstract: Effective agent performance relies on the ability to compose tools and agents into effective workflows. However, progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is limited by the scarcity of scalable, reliable evaluation data. This study addresses this limitation by identifying a suitable workflow domain for LLM application. I introduce NL2Flow, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems, which are expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL, and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. NL2Flow generates a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems in automated workflow generation and evaluates multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs without task-specific optimization or architectural modifications. Results reveal that the highest performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible plans. Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. To investigate the potential of LLMs as natural language-to-JSON translators for workflow definition, and to facilitate integration with downstream symbolic computation tools and a symbolic planner, I evaluated the LLM's translation performance on natural language workflow descriptions. I observed that translating natural language into a JSON representation of a workflow problem yielded a lower success rate than generating a plan directly, suggesting that unnecessary decomposition of the reasoning task may degrade performance and highlighting the benefit of models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

We show how (deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation (negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming (ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.

<title>From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents</title>

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a novel contrastive RL algorithm.
  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x3.12 on L40, x2.50 on RTX 3090, x2.39 on H100, and x2.37 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources. We also identify important challenges posed by training RL models for tasks like CUDA development, where RL often learns to exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than solve the intended optimization problems. By identifying these failure modes and analyzing their root causes, we develop practical methods for creating more robust training procedures that prevent reward hacking.

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-making systems are increasingly popular, significant concerns on the potential discrimination during the AI decision-making process have been observed. For example, the distribution of predictions is usually biased and dependents on the sensitive attributes (e.g., gender and ethnicity). Numerous approaches have therefore been proposed to develop decision-making systems that are discrimination-conscious by-design, which are typically batch-based and require the simultaneous availability of all the training data for model learning. However, in the real-world, the data streams usually come on the fly which requires the model to process each input data once ``on arrival'' and without the need for storage and reprocessing. In addition, the data streams might also evolve over time, which further requires the model to be able to simultaneously adapt to non-stationary data distributions and time-evolving bias patterns, with an effective and robust trade-off between accuracy and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of online decision tree with fairness in the data stream with possible distribution drifting. Specifically, first, we propose two novel fairness splitting criteria that encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously removing dependence on the sensitive attributes, and further adapts to non-stationary distribution with fine-grained control when needed. Second, we propose two fairness decision tree online growth algorithms that fulfills different online fair decision-making requirements. Our experiments show that our algorithms are able to deal with discrimination in massive and non-stationary streaming environments, with a better trade-off between fairness and predictive performance.

Abstract: AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in many complex board games such as Chess, Shogi, and Go. However, we showcase that these algorithms encounter significant and fundamental challenges when applied to impartial games, a class where players share game pieces and optimal strategy often relies on abstract mathematical principles. Specifically, we utilize the game of Nim as a concrete and illustrative case study to reveal critical limitations of AlphaZero-style and similar self-play RL algorithms. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing between champion and expert mastery to evaluate RL agent performance. Our findings reveal that while AlphaZero-style agents can achieve champion-level play on very small Nim boards, their learning progression severely degrades as the board size increases. This difficulty stems not merely from complex data distributions or noisy labels, but from a deeper representational bottleneck: the inherent struggle of generic neural networks to implicitly learn abstract, non-associative functions like parity, which are crucial for optimal play in impartial games. This limitation causes a critical breakdown in the positive feedback loop essential for self-play RL, preventing effective learning beyond rote memorization of frequently observed states. These results align with broader concerns regarding AlphaZero-style algorithms' vulnerability to adversarial attacks, highlighting their inability to truly master all legal game states. Our work underscores that simple hyperparameter adjustments are insufficient to overcome these challenges, establishing a crucial foundation for the development of fundamentally novel algorithmic approaches, potentially involving neuro-symbolic or meta-learning paradigms, to bridge the gap towards true expert-level AI in combinatorial games.

Abstract: The use of AI in microservices (MSs) is an emerging field as indicated by a substantial number of surveys. However these surveys focus on a specific problem using specific AI techniques, therefore not fully capturing the growth of research and the rise and disappearance of trends. In our systematic mapping study, we take an exhaustive approach to reveal all possible connections between the use of AI techniques for improving any quality attribute (QA) of MSs during the DevOps phases. Our results include 16 research themes that connect to the intersection of particular QAs, AI domains and DevOps phases. Moreover by mapping identified future research challenges and relevant industry domains, we can show that many studies aim to deliver prototypes to be automated at a later stage, aiming at providing exploitable products in a number of key industry domains.

Abstract: Small language models like T5 excel in generating high-quality text for data-to-text tasks, offering adaptability and cost-efficiency compared to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they frequently miss keywords, which is considered one of the most severe and common errors in this task. In this work, we explore the potential of using feedback systems to enhance semantic fidelity in smaller language models for data-to-text generation tasks, through our Verification and Correction Prompting (VCP) approach. In the inference stage, our approach involves a multi-step process, including generation, verification, and regeneration stages. During the verification stage, we implement a simple rule to check for the presence of every keyword in the prediction. Recognizing that this rule can be inaccurate, we have developed a carefully designed training procedure, which enabling the model to incorporate feedback from the error-correcting prompt effectively, despite its potential inaccuracies. The VCP approach effectively reduces the Semantic Error Rate (SER) while maintaining the text's quality.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel multimodal food recognition framework that effectively combines visual and textual modalities to enhance classification accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach employs a dynamic multimodal fusion strategy that adaptively integrates features from unimodal visual inputs and complementary textual metadata. This fusion mechanism is designed to maximize the use of informative content, while mitigating the adverse impact of missing or inconsistent modality data. The framework was rigorously evaluated on the UPMC Food-101 dataset and achieved unimodal classification accuracies of 73.60% for images and 88.84% for text. When both modalities were fused, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.84%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrated the robustness, adaptability, and computational efficiency of the proposed settings, highlighting its practical applicability to real-world multimodal food-recognition scenarios.

Abstract: Local learning offers an alternative to traditional end-to-end back-propagation in deep neural networks, significantly reducing GPU memory consumption. Although it has shown promise in image classification tasks, its extension to other visual tasks has been limited. This limitation arises primarily from two factors: 1) architectures designed specifically for classification are not readily adaptable to other tasks, which prevents the effective reuse of task-specific knowledge from architectures tailored to different problems; 2) these classification-focused architectures typically lack cross-scale feature communication, leading to degraded performance in tasks like object detection and super-resolution. To address these challenges, we propose the Feature Bank Augmented auxiliary network (FBA), which introduces a simplified design principle and incorporates a feature bank to enhance cross-task adaptability and communication. This work represents the first successful application of local learning methods beyond classification, demonstrating that FBA not only conserves GPU memory but also achieves performance on par with end-to-end approaches across multiple datasets for various visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to develop agents capable of navigating in realistic environments. While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km$^2$ across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance.

<title>GS-ID: Illumination Decomposition on Gaussian Splatting via Adaptive Light Aggregation and Diffusion-Guided Material Priors</title>

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as an effective representation for photorealistic rendering, but the underlying geometry, material, and lighting remain entangled, hindering scene editing. Existing GS-based methods struggle to disentangle these components under non-Lambertian conditions, especially in the presence of specularities and shadows. We propose \textbf{GS-ID}, an end-to-end framework for illumination decomposition that integrates adaptive light aggregation with diffusion-based material priors. In addition to a learnable environment map for ambient illumination, we model spatially-varying local lighting using anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixtures (SGMs) that are jointly optimized with scene content. To better capture cast shadows, we associate each splat with a learnable unit vector that encodes shadow directions from multiple light sources, further improving material and lighting estimation. By combining SGMs with intrinsic priors from diffusion models, GS-ID significantly reduces ambiguity in light-material-geometry interactions and achieves state-of-the-art performance on inverse rendering and relighting benchmarks. Experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-ID for downstream applications such as relighting and scene composition.

Abstract: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is critical for a variety of real-world robotic applications. However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.

Abstract: We present three game-playing agents incorporating Vision Transformers (ViT) into the AlphaZero framework: AlphaViT, AlphaViD (AlphaViT with a transformer decoder), and AlphaVDA (AlphaViD with learnable action embeddings). These agents can play multiple board games of varying sizes using a single neural network with shared weights, thus overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed board sizes. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both a transformer encoder and a decoder. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses learnable embeddings as the decoder inputs. The additional decoder in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provides flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or on multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms, such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search. They approach the performance of AlphaZero despite relying on a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT performs strongly across all evaluated games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN with weights pre-trained on small board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, that of single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures for developing more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Music classification, a cornerstone of music information retrieval, supports a wide array of applications. To address the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective methods for sub-genre classification in mainstage dance music, we introduce a novel benchmark featuring a new dataset and baseline. Our dataset expands the scope of sub-genres to reflect the diversity of recent mainstage live sets performed by leading DJs at global music festivals, capturing the vibrant and rapidly evolving electronic dance music (EDM) scene that engages millions of fans worldwide. We employ a continuous soft labeling approach to accommodate tracks blending multiple sub-genres, preserving their inherent complexity. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, while our specialized baseline models achieve high accuracy. This benchmark supports applications such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia systems, with video demos provided. Our code and data are all open-sourced at https://github.com/Gariscat/housex-v2.git.

Abstract: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance for SSC, surpassing most existing methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGFounder

Abstract: Mobile traffic forecasting allows operators to anticipate network dynamics and performance in advance, offering substantial potential for enhancing service quality and improving user experience. However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand across domains, LLM judges have become essential for systems evaluation. Current benchmarks typically compare system outputs against baselines. This baseline-mediated approach, though convenient, yields lower reliability than direct comparison between systems. We propose Arena-Lite which integrates tournament structure on top of head-to-head comparison. The application of a tournament structure and direct comparison eliminates the need for baseline outputs, reduces the number of required comparisons, and allows higher reliability in system rankings. We conducted two experiments: (1) controlled stochastic modeling and (2) empirical validation with a real LLM judge. Those experiments collectively demonstrate that Arena-Lite consistently achieves higher reliability with fewer comparisons, even with smaller datasets or weaker judges. We release an easy-to-use web demonstration and code to foster adoption of Arena-Lite, streamlining model selection across research and industry communities. Arena-Lite demo and code are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/spaces/NCSOFT/ArenaLite}{https://huggingface.co/spaces/NCSOFT/ArenaLite}

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the notion of ``slow thinking'' into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that models can learn to adaptively use different levels of reasoning to tackle questions of different complexity. We propose a novel paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which comprises of minimal semantic atomic steps. Different from existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method can not only generate cognitive CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomena of overthinking for easier tasks. To introduce structured reasoning into visual cognition, we further design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules, including (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single step utilization rate. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 times and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%. Our code is now public available in https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.

arXiv:2411.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models that bridge vision and language have made significant progress. While they have inspired many life-enriching applications, their potential for abuse in creating new threats remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) can be weaponized to enhance gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) in federated learning (FL), where an FL server attempts to reconstruct private data samples from gradients shared by victim clients. Despite recent advances, existing GIAs struggle to reconstruct high-resolution images when the victim has a large local data batch. One promising direction is to focus reconstruction on valuable samples rather than the entire batch, but current methods lack the flexibility to target specific data of interest. To address this gap, we propose Geminio, the first approach to transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. It enables a brand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural language, the data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize reconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by leveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global model that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients of samples that match the attacker-specified query. Geminio can be launched at any FL round and has no impact on normal training (i.e., the FL server can steal clients' data while still producing a high-utility ML model as in benign scenarios). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing and reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex datasets and large batch sizes with resilience against defenses.

Abstract: Current human motion synthesis frameworks rely on global action descriptions, creating a modality gap that limits both motion understanding and generation capabilities. A single coarse description, such as run, fails to capture details such as variations in speed, limb positioning, and kinematic dynamics, leading to ambiguities between text and motion modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce KinMo, a unified framework built on a hierarchical describable motion representation that extends beyond global actions by incorporating kinematic group movements and their interactions. We design an automated annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, fine-grained descriptions for this decomposition, resulting in the KinMo dataset and offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for dataset enrichment. To leverage these structured descriptions, we propose Hierarchical Text-Motion Alignment that progressively integrates additional motion details, thereby improving semantic motion understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine motion generation procedure to leverage enhanced spatial understanding to improve motion synthesis. Experimental results show that KinMo significantly improves motion understanding, demonstrated by enhanced text-motion retrieval performance and enabling more fine-grained motion generation and editing capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving. This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by employing GPT-4 for meta-template creation, guaranteeing diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills. The code and data are available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.

Abstract: Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from the gradient exchange of neural networks during federated learning. However, the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attacks, i.e., reconstructing both node features and graph structure from gradients, remains largely underexplored. To answer this question, this paper studies the problem of whether private data can be reconstructed from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG). Two widely used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on reconstruction are extensively discussed. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that, by leveraging the unique properties of graph data and GNNs, GLG achieves more accurate reconstruction of both nodal features and graph structure from gradients.

arXiv:2412.00560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overfitting has traditionally been viewed as detrimental to anomaly detection, where excessive generalization often limits models' sensitivity to subtle anomalies. Our work challenges this conventional view by introducing Controllable Overfitting-based Anomaly Detection (COAD), a novel framework that strategically leverages overfitting to enhance anomaly discrimination capabilities. We propose the Aberrance Retention Quotient (ARQ), a novel metric that systematically quantifies the extent of overfitting, enabling the identification of an optimal golden overfitting interval wherein model sensitivity to anomalies is maximized without sacrificing generalization. To comprehensively capture how overfitting affects detection performance, we further propose the Relative Anomaly Distribution Index (RADI), a metric superior to traditional AUROC by explicitly modeling the separation between normal and anomalous score distributions. Theoretically, RADI leverages ARQ to track and evaluate how overfitting impacts anomaly detection, offering an integrated approach to understanding the relationship between overfitting dynamics and model efficacy. We also rigorously validate the statistical efficacy of Gaussian noise as pseudo-anomaly generators, reinforcing the method's broad applicability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our controllable overfitting method achieves State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) performance in both one-class and multi-class anomaly detection tasks, thus redefining overfitting as a powerful strategy rather than a limitation.

arXiv:2412.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the programming languages for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Structured Text (ST) is widely adopted for industrial automation due to its expressiveness and flexibility. However, major vendors implement ST with proprietary extensions and hardware-specific libraries - Siemens' SCL and CODESYS' ST each differ in syntax and functionality. This fragmentation forces engineers to relearn implementation details across platforms, creating substantial productivity barriers. To address this challenge, we developed AutoPLC, a framework capable of automatically generating vendor-aware ST code directly from natural language requirements. Our solution begins by building two essential knowledge sources tailored to each vendor's specifications: a structured API library containing platform-exclusive functions, and an annotated case database that captures real-world implementation experience. Building on these foundations, we created a four-stage generation process that combines step-wise planning (enhanced with a lightweight natural language state machine support for control logic), contextual case retrieval using LLM-based reranking, API recommendation guided by industrial data, and dynamic validation through direct interaction with vendor IDEs. Implemented for Siemens TIA Portal and the CODESYS platform, AutoPLC achieves 90%+ compilation success on our 914-task benchmark (covering general-purpose and process control functions), outperforming all selected baselines, at an average cost of only $0.13 per task. Experienced PLC engineers positively assessed the practical utility of the generated code, including cases that failed compilation. We open-source our framework at https://github.com/cangkui/AutoPLC.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks. Building on CSI-BERT, we introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. We also introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based temporal embedding module to mitigate permutation invariance issues in time-series CSI data. This significantly improves the CSI classification performance of the original CSI-BERT model. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address.

<title>Mix-LN: Unleashing the Power of Deeper Layers by Combining Pre-LN and Post-LN</title>

arXiv:2412.13795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent findings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be pruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an opportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall rooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We demonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads to diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their effectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger gradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier layers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique that combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN applies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring more uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the network--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training. Extensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that Mix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more balanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the overall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models pre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep layers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current LLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without increasing model size.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive ability to utilise information within the context of their input sequences to appropriately respond to data unseen by the LLM during its training procedure. This ability is known as in-context learning (ICL). Humans and non-human animals demonstrate similar abilities, however their neural architectures differ substantially from LLMs. Despite this, a critical component within LLMs, the attention mechanism, resembles modern associative memory models, widely used in and influenced by the computational neuroscience community to model biological memory systems. Using this connection, we introduce an associative memory model capable of performing ICL. We use this as inspiration for a novel residual stream architecture which allows information to directly flow between attention heads. We test this architecture during training within a two-layer Transformer and show its ICL abilities manifest more quickly than without this modification. We then apply our architecture in small language models with 8 million and 1 billion parameters, focusing on attention head values, with results also indicating improved performance at these larger and more naturalistic scales.

Abstract: Solving complex reasoning tasks is a key real-world application of agents. Thanks to the pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) on code data, recent approaches like CodeAct successfully use code as LLM agents' action, achieving good results. However, CodeAct greedily generates the next action's code block by relying on fragmented thoughts, resulting in inconsistency and instability. Moreover, CodeAct lacks action-related ground-truth (GT), making its supervision signals and termination conditions questionable in multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we first introduce a simple yet effective end-to-end code generation paradigm, CodeProgram, which leverages code's systematic logic to align with global reasoning and enable cohesive problem-solving. Then, we propose Tree-of-Code (ToC), which self-grows CodeProgram nodes based on the executable nature of the code and enables self-supervision in a GT-free scenario. Experimental results on two datasets using ten popular zero-shot LLMs show ToC remarkably boosts accuracy by nearly 20% over CodeAct with less than 1/4 turns. Several LLMs even perform better on one-turn CodeProgram than on multi-turn CodeAct. To further investigate the trade-off between efficacy and efficiency, we test different ToC tree sizes and exploration mechanisms. We also highlight the potential of ToC's end-to-end data generation for supervised and reinforced fine-tuning.

<title>Assessing Social Alignment: Do Personality-Prompted Large Language Models Behave Like Humans?</title>

Abstract: The ongoing revolution in language modeling has led to various novel applications, some of which rely on the emerging social abilities of large language models (LLMs). Already, many turn to the new cyber friends for advice during the pivotal moments of their lives and trust them with the deepest secrets, implying that accurate shaping of the LLM's personality is paramount. To this end, state-of-the-art approaches exploit a vast variety of training data, and prompt the model to adopt a particular personality. We ask (i) if personality-prompted models behave (i.e., make decisions when presented with a social situation) in line with the ascribed personality (ii) if their behavior can be finely controlled. We use classic psychological experiments, the Milgram experiment and the Ultimatum Game, as social interaction testbeds and apply personality prompting to open- and closed-source LLMs from 4 different vendors. Our experiments reveal failure modes of the prompt-based modulation of the models' behavior that are shared across all models tested and persist under prompt perturbations. These findings challenge the optimistic sentiment toward personality prompting generally held in the community.

<title>Progressive Growing of Video Tokenizers for Temporally Compact Latent Spaces</title>

Abstract: Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to directly training the full model. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a significantly reduced token budget.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical challenge: providing feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs potentially outperform humans. In such scenarios, leveraging the critique ability of LLMs themselves - identifying and correcting flaws - shows considerable promise. This paper explores enhancing critique abilities of LLMs, noting that current approaches rely on human annotations or more powerful models, leaving the challenge of improving critique abilities without external supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework that trains LLMs with self-generated data to evolve their critique abilities. To address the low quality of naively generated data, we propose a contrastive-critic approach that uses reference solutions during data synthesis to enhance the model's understanding of key concepts, and incorporates a self-validation scheme to ensure data quality. The final trained model operates without any reference solutions at inference time. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, a leading LLM, SCRIT demonstrates consistent improvements across a wide range of benchmarks spanning both mathematical and scientific reasoning: achieving a 10.0\% relative gain in critique-correction accuracy and a 19.0\% relative improvement in error identification F1-score. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales positively with data and model size and enables continuous improvement through multi-round iterations.

Abstract: Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.

Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained since the first time step. We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we introduce an agent that combines DQN and the core ideas of distributional DP, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.

Abstract: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection. We open-source the project and our models.

Abstract: Inverse Constraint Learning (ICL) is the problem of inferring constraints from safe (i.e., constraint-satisfying) demonstrations. The hope is that these inferred constraints can then be used downstream to search for safe policies for new tasks and, potentially, under different dynamics. Our paper explores the question of what mathematical entity ICL recovers. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that both in theory and in practice, ICL recovers the set of states where failure is inevitable, rather than the set of states where failure has already happened. In the language of safe control, this means we recover a backwards reachable tube (BRT) rather than a failure set. In contrast to the failure set, the BRT depends on the dynamics of the data collection system. We discuss the implications of the dynamics-conditionedness of the recovered constraint on both the sample-efficiency of policy search and the transferability of learned constraints.

<title>MCTS-SQL: Light-Weight LLMs can Master the Text-to-SQL through Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

arXiv:2501.16607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP area, aiming at translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.

<title>BEAT: Balanced Frequency Adaptive Tuning for Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is crucial for numerous real-world applications including weather prediction and financial market modeling. While temporal-domain methods remain prevalent, frequency-domain approaches can effectively capture multi-scale periodic patterns, reduce sequence dependencies, and naturally denoise signals. However, existing approaches typically train model components for all frequencies under a unified training objective, often leading to mismatched learning speeds: high-frequency components converge faster and risk overfitting, while low-frequency components underfit due to insufficient training time. To deal with this challenge, we propose BEAT (Balanced frEquency Adaptive Tuning), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the training status for each frequency and adaptively adjusts their gradient updates. By recognizing convergence, overfitting, or underfitting for each frequency, BEAT dynamically reallocates learning priorities, moderating gradients for rapid learners and increasing those for slower ones, alleviating the tension between competing objectives across frequencies and synchronizing the overall learning process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, the proposed approach in this paper performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the \emph{Semi-Supervised Learning} (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, {i.e}., zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method outperforms supervised-based approaches in reward inference, leading to higher agent scores. Notably, in more sparse-reward environments, our method achieves up to twice the peak scores compared to supervised baselines. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods

Abstract: How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency for consecutive time steps. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.

Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report highlights the possibility of predicting model performance on downstream tasks using only pre-training signals, though detailed methodologies are absent. Such predictive capabilities are essential for resource-efficient pre-training and the construction of task-aligned datasets. In this paper, we aim to predict performance in closed-book question answering (QA), a vital downstream task that directly reflects a model's internalized knowledge without the help of external tools. We address three primary challenges: (1) limited access to and understanding of pre-training corpora, (2) limitations of current evaluation methods for pre-trained models, and (3) limitations of frequency-based metrics in predicting model performance. In response, we conduct large-scale retrieval and semantic analysis across the pre-training corpora of 21 publicly available and 3 custom-trained large language models. We then develop a multi-template QA evaluation framework incorporating paraphrased question variants. Building on these foundations, we propose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic metric that linearly correlates pre-training data characteristics, model size, and QA accuracy, without requiring additional training. Experimental results show that SMI outperforms co-occurrence-based baselines, achieving $R^2 > 0.75$ on models with over one billion parameters. Theoretical analysis further suggests an upper bound of around 80% QA accuracy under optimal pre-training, reflecting intrinsic memory limitations and motivating the use of retrieval or few-shot methods in later stages.

Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) with mixed modalities enables unimodal and multimodal clients to collaboratively train models while ensuring clients' privacy. As a representative sample of local data, prototypes offer an approach with low resource consumption and no reliance on prior knowledge for MFL with mixed modalities. However, existing prototype-based MFL methods assume unified labels across clients and identical tasks per client, which is impractical in MFL with mixed modalities. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based Multimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities to address the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through adaptively-constructed prototypes without unified labels. Clients adaptively select prototype construction methods in line with labels; server converts client prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and cluster them to form global prototypes. To address model aggregation issues in task heterogeneity, we develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust aggregation weights. Furthermore, we propose a global prototype knowledge transfer loss and a global model knowledge transfer loss to enable the transfer of global knowledge to local knowledge. Experimental results show that AproMFL outperforms four baselines on three highly heterogeneous datasets ($\alpha=0.1$) and two heterogeneous tasks, with the optimal results in accuracy and recall being 0.42%~6.09% and 1.6%~3.89% higher than those of FedIoT (FedAvg-based MFL), respectively.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

arXiv:2502.05213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more powerful, concerns over copyright infringement of LLM-generated texts have intensified. LLM watermarking has been proposed to trace unauthorized redistribution or resale of generated content by embedding identifiers within the text. Existing approaches primarily rely on one-bit watermarking, which only verifies whether a text was generated by a specific LLM. In contrast, multi-bit watermarking encodes richer information, enabling the identification of the specific LLM and user involved in generated or distributed content. However, current multi-bit methods directly embed the watermark into the text without considering its watermark capacity, which can result in failures, especially in low-entropy texts. In this paper, we analyze that the watermark embedding follows a normal distribution. We then derive a formal inequality to optimally segment the text for watermark embedding. Building upon this, we propose DERMARK, a dynamic, efficient, and robust multi-bit watermarking method that divides the text into variable-length segments for each watermark bit during the inference. Moreover, DERMARK incurs negligible overhead since no additional intermediate matrices are generated and achieves robustness against text editing by minimizing watermark extraction loss. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to SOTA, on average, our method reduces the number of tokens required per embedded bit by 25\%, reduces watermark embedding time by 50\%, and maintains high robustness against text modifications and watermark erasure attacks.

Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We develop a very general framework to construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which an arbitrary sequential detection algorithm declares a change. Our framework is nonparametric, making no assumption on the composite post-change class, the observation space, or the sequential detection procedure used, and is nonasymptotically valid. We also extend it to handle composite pre-change classes under a suitable assumption, and also derive confidence sets for the change magnitude in parametric settings. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the produced sets have reasonable size, and slightly conservative coverage. In summary, we present the first general method for sequential changepoint localization, which is theoretically sound and broadly applicable in practice.

Abstract: Healthcare systems are struggling to meet the growing demand for neurological care, particularly in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We propose that LLM-based generative AI systems can enhance clinician capabilities to approach specialist-level assessment and decision-making in ADRD care at scale. This article presents a comprehensive six-phase roadmap for responsible design and integration of such systems into ADRD care: (1) high-quality standardized data collection across modalities; (2) decision support; (3) clinical integration enhancing workflows; (4) rigorous validation and monitoring protocols; (5) continuous learning through clinical feedback; and (6) robust ethics and risk management frameworks. This human centered approach optimizes clinicians' capabilities in comprehensive data collection, interpretation of complex clinical information, and timely application of relevant medical knowledge while prioritizing patient safety, healthcare equity, and transparency. Though focused on ADRD, these principles offer broad applicability across medical specialties facing similar systemic challenges.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for creating lifelike avatars and enhancing human-computer interactions by synchronizing gestures with speech. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1.

<title>Raising the Bar in Graph OOD Generalization: Invariant Learning Beyond Explicit Environment Modeling</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a critical challenge in graph learning, as real-world graph data often exhibit diverse and shifting environments that traditional models fail to generalize across. A promising solution to address this issue is graph invariant learning (GIL), which aims to learn invariant representations by disentangling label-correlated invariant subgraphs from environment-specific subgraphs. However, existing GIL methods face two major challenges: (1) the difficulty of capturing and modeling diverse environments in graph data, and (2) the semantic cliff, where invariant subgraphs from different classes are difficult to distinguish, leading to poor class separability and increased misclassifications. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Multi-Prototype Hyperspherical Invariant Learning (MPHIL), which introduces two key innovations: (1) hyperspherical invariant representation extraction, enabling robust and highly discriminative hyperspherical invariant feature extraction, and (2) multi-prototype hyperspherical classification, which employs class prototypes as intermediate variables to eliminate the need for explicit environment modeling in GIL and mitigate the semantic cliff issue. Derived from the theoretical framework of GIL, we introduce two novel objective functions: the invariant prototype matching loss to ensure samples are matched to the correct class prototypes, and the prototype separation loss to increase the distinction between prototypes of different classes in the hyperspherical space. Extensive experiments on 11 OOD generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPHIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods across graph data from various domains and with different distribution shifts.

Abstract: The rampdown phase of a tokamak pulse is difficult to simulate and often exacerbates multiple plasma instabilities. To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty and demonstrates the relevance of SciML for fusion experiments.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Dealing with this trade-off is still an open challenge in designing AI systems for creativity. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We show that our score can be used as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments considering a variety of creative tasks, such as poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.

<title>Towards Question Answering over Large Semi-structured Tables</title>

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) attracts strong interests due to the prevalence of web information presented in the form of semi-structured tables. Despite many efforts, TableQA over large tables remains an open challenge. This is because large tables may overwhelm models that try to comprehend them in full to locate question answers. Recent studies reduce input table size by decomposing tables into smaller, question-relevant sub-tables via generating programs to parse the tables. However, such solutions are subject to program generation and execution errors and are difficult to ensure decomposition quality. To address this issue, we propose TaDRe, a TableQA model that incorporates both pre- and post-table decomposition refinements to ensure table decomposition quality, hence achieving highly accurate TableQA results. To evaluate TaDRe, we construct two new large-table TableQA benchmarks via LLM-driven table expansion and QA pair generation. Extensive experiments on both the new and public benchmarks show that TaDRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-table TableQA tasks.

Abstract: Despite their growing capabilities, language models still frequently reproduce content from their training data, generate repetitive text, and favor common grammatical patterns and vocabulary. A possible cause is the decoding strategy: the most common strategies either consider only the most probable tokens, which reduces output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens, compromising output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose DiffSampling, a new decoding method that leverages a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution to ensure the generation of contextually appropriate text. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to truncate incorrect tokens. In addition, we also propose two variations of the proposed method that aim to correct the subtle inconsistencies of common sampling strategies. Experiments involving four different text-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach consistently performs at least on par with the existing methods it builds upon in terms of quality, while potentially improving output diversity.

<title>Type 1 Diabetes Management using GLIMMER: Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate</title>

Abstract: Managing Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) demands constant vigilance as individuals strive to regulate their blood glucose levels to avoid the harmful effects of dysglycemia, including both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Despite the development of advanced technologies such as automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, achieving optimal glycemic control remains challenging. AID systems combine continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), offering potential benefits in reducing glucose variability and increasing time-in-range. However, these systems still frequently fail to prevent dysglycemia, partly due to limitations in their prediction algorithms, which lack the accuracy needed to avert abnormal glucose events. This shortcoming highlights the need for more advanced glucose forecasting methods. To address this need, we introduce GLIMMER, Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate, a machine learning-based model for predicting blood glucose levels. GLIMMER classifies glucose values into normal and abnormal ranges and employs a novel custom loss function that prioritizes accuracy in dysglycemic regions, where patient safety is most critical. To evaluate GLIMMER's effectiveness for T1D management, we used both a publicly available dataset and a newly collected dataset involving 25 individuals with T1D. In forecasting glucose levels for the next hour, GLIMMER achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.97 (+/-3.77) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.83 (+/-2.09) mg/dL. These results represent a 23% improvement in RMSE and a 31% improvement in MAE compared to the best previously reported models.

<title>Control Illusion: The Failure of Instruction Hierarchies in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with hierarchical instruction schemes, where certain instructions (e.g., system-level directives) are expected to take precedence over others (e.g., user messages). Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation. We find that LLMs more reliably obey constraints framed through natural social hierarchies (e.g., authority, expertise, consensus) than system/user roles, which suggests that pretraining-derived social structures act as latent control priors, with potentially stronger influence than post-training guardrails.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate data analysis through executable code generation. Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows - the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether a LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.
  To address this, we present $\it{AIRepr}$, an $\it{A}$nalyst - $\it{I}$nspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the $\it{Repr}$oducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for more transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.

Abstract: Weakly supervised monocular 3D detection, while less annotation-intensive, often struggles to capture the global context required for reliable 3D reasoning. Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different financial analysis tasks designed by domain experts, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.

Abstract: Safety has been of paramount importance in motion planning and control techniques and is an active area of research in the past few years. Most safety research for mobile robots target at maintaining safety with the notion of collision avoidance. However, safety goes beyond just avoiding collisions, especially when robots have to navigate unstructured, vertically challenging, off-road terrain, where vehicle rollover and immobilization is as critical as collisions. In this work, we introduce a novel Traversability-based Control Barrier Function (T-CBF), in which we use neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to achieve safety beyond collision avoidance on unstructured vertically challenging terrain by reasoning about new safety aspects in terms of traversability. The neural T-CBF trained on safe and unsafe observations specific to traversability safety is then used to generate safe trajectories. Furthermore, we present experimental results in simulation and on a physical Verti-4 Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that T-CBF can provide traversability safety while reaching the goal position. T-CBF planner outperforms previously developed planners by 30\% in terms of keeping the robot safe and mobile when navigating on real world vertically challenging terrain.

Abstract: Simulating the complex interactions between soft tissues and rigid anatomy is critical for applications in surgical training, planning, and robotic-assisted interventions. Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.

Abstract: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. The image-caption dataset, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/IBM/MS-CLIP.

Abstract: We formulate the motor system of an interactive avatar as a generative motion model that can drive the body to move through 3D space in a perpetual, realistic, controllable, and responsive manner. Although human motion generation has been extensively studied, many existing methods lack the responsiveness and realism of real human movements. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, we propose PRIMAL, which is learned with a two-stage paradigm. In the pretraining stage, the model learns body movements from a large number of sub-second motion segments, providing a generative foundation from which more complex motions are built. This training is fully unsupervised without annotations. Given a single-frame initial state during inference, the pretrained model not only generates unbounded, realistic, and controllable motion, but also enables the avatar to be responsive to induced impulses in real time. In the adaptation phase, we employ a novel ControlNet-like adaptor to fine-tune the base model efficiently, adapting it to new tasks such as few-shot personalized action generation and spatial target reaching. Evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We leverage the model to create a real-time character animation system in Unreal Engine that feels highly responsive and natural.

Abstract: There is an overwhelming abundance of works in AI Ethics. This growth is chaotic because of how sudden it is, its volume, and its multidisciplinary nature. This makes difficult to keep track of debates, and to systematically characterize goals, research questions, methods, and expertise required by AI ethicists. In this article, I show that the relation between AI and ethics can be characterized in at least three ways, which correspond to three well-represented kinds of AI ethics: ethics and AI; ethics in AI; ethics of AI. I elucidate the features of these three kinds of AI Ethics, characterize their research questions, and identify the kind of expertise that each kind needs. I also show how certain criticisms to AI ethics are misplaced, as being done from the point of view of one kind of AI ethics, to another kind with different goals. All in all, this work sheds light on the nature of AI ethics, and sets the groundwork for more informed discussions about the scope, methods, and training of AI ethicists.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable software release decisions is critical in safety-critical domains such as automotive manufacturing. Release validation relies on large tabular datasets, yet manual analysis is slow, costly, and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential, they face challenges in analytical reasoning, structured data handling, and ambiguity resolution. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based system for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and generates optimized Python code. Unlike traditional multi-agent or planning-based systems that can be slow, opaque, and costly to maintain, GateLens emphasizes speed, transparency, and reliability. Experimental results show that GateLens outperforms the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency (SC) based system on real-world datasets, particularly in handling complex and ambiguous queries. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of the RA layer. Industrial deployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high accuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release candidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings without requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration. This work advances deployable LLM system design by identifying key architectural features-intermediate formal representations, execution efficiency, and low configuration overhead-crucial for safety-critical industrial applications.

Abstract: The differences between images belonging to fine-grained categories are often subtle and highly localized, and existing explainability techniques for deep learning models are often too diffuse to provide useful and interpretable explanations. We propose a new explainability method (PAIR-X) that leverages both intermediate model activations and backpropagated relevance scores to generate fine-grained, highly-localized pairwise visual explanations. We use animal and building re-identification (re-ID) as a primary case study of our method, and we demonstrate qualitatively improved results over a diverse set of explainability baselines on 35 public re-ID datasets. In interviews, animal re-ID experts found PAIR-X to be a meaningful improvement over existing baselines for deep model explainability, and suggested that its visualizations would be directly applicable to their work. We also propose a novel quantitative evaluation metric for our method, and demonstrate that PAIR-X visualizations appear more plausible for correct image matches than incorrect ones even when the model similarity score for the pairs is the same. By improving interpretability, PAIR-X enables humans to better distinguish correct and incorrect matches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/pairx-explains/pairx

Abstract: Spurious correlations, unstable statistical shortcuts a model can exploit, are expected to degrade performance out-of-distribution (OOD). However, across many popular OOD generalization benchmarks, vanilla empirical risk minimization (ERM) often achieves the highest OOD accuracy. Moreover, gains in in-distribution accuracy generally improve OOD accuracy, a phenomenon termed accuracy on the line, which contradicts the expected harm of spurious correlations. We show that these observations are an artifact of misspecified OOD datasets that do not include shifts in spurious correlations that harm OOD generalization, the setting they are meant to evaluate. Consequently, current practice evaluates "robustness" without truly stressing the spurious signals we seek to eliminate; our work pinpoints when that happens and how to fix it. Contributions. (i) We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a distribution shift to reveal a model's reliance on spurious features; when these conditions hold, "accuracy on the line" disappears. (ii) We audit leading OOD datasets and find that most still display accuracy on the line, suggesting they are misspecified for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations. (iii) We catalog the few well-specified datasets and summarize generalizable design principles, such as identifying datasets of natural interventions (e.g., a pandemic), to guide future well-specified benchmarks.

<title>Token Pruning in Audio Transformers: Optimizing Performance and Decoding Patch Importance</title>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various computer vision tasks, but their high computational cost remains a challenge. Token pruning has been proposed to reduce this cost by selectively removing less important tokens. While effective in vision tasks by discarding non-object regions, applying this technique to audio tasks presents unique challenges, as distinguishing relevant from irrelevant regions in time-frequency representations is less straightforward. In this study, for the first time, we applied token pruning to ViT-based audio classification models using Mel-spectrograms and analyzed the trade-offs between model performance and computational cost: TopK token pruning can reduce MAC operations of AudioMAE and AST by 30-40%, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy. Our analysis reveals that while high-intensity or high-variation tokens contribute significantly to model accuracy, low-intensity or low variation tokens also remain important when token pruning is applied; pruning solely based on the intensity or variation of signals in a patch leads to a noticeable drop in accuracy. We support our claim by measuring high correlation between attention scores and these statistical features and by showing retained tokens consistently receive distinct attention compared to pruned ones. We also show that AudioMAE retains more low-intensity tokens than AST. This can be explained by AudioMAE's self-supervised reconstruction objective, which encourages attention to all patches, whereas AST's supervised training focuses on label-relevant tokens.

<title>Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs</title>

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.

<title>LoRI: Reducing Cross-Task Interference in Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in multi-task scenarios. We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet effective approach that freezes the projection matrices $A$ as random projections and sparsifies the matrices $B$ using task-specific masks. This design substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task interference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter subspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference. Code is available at: https://github.com/juzhengz/LoRI

Abstract: Generative AI has recently had a profound impact on various fields, including daily life, research, and education. To explore its efficient utilization in data-driven materials science, we organized a hackathon -- AIMHack2024 -- in July 2024. In this hackathon, researchers from fields such as materials science, information science, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics worked together to explore how generative AI can facilitate research and education. Based on the results of the hackathon, this paper presents topics related to (1) conducting AI-assisted software trials, (2) building AI tutors for software, and (3) developing GUI applications for software. While generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, this paper provides an early record of its application in data-driven materials science and highlights strategies for integrating AI into research and education.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities on various tasks. However, LRMs often suffer from an ``overthinking'' problem, where the model generates excessively redundant reasoning steps with limited performance gains. In this work, we empirically reveal an important characteristic of LRM behaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the thinking token (\texttt{} and \texttt{}) can effectively manipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on this finding, we propose a simple yet efficient pipeline, \Method, to enable LRMs to bypass unnecessary intermediate steps, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the utility and efficiency of \Method. For instance, when applied to QwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code dataset, \Method keeps the original performance while reducing output token counts by approximately 30\%, with minimal overhead introduced by the CoT generator. Furthermore, we identify two suboptimal modes, blindly following flawed external thoughts and unnecessary rethinking, and show that simple mitigations, such as difficulty-aware fallbacks, can further improve performance. Overall, \Method offers a practical, general, and efficient way to optimize LRM inference, making powerful reasoning models more accessible and scalable for real-world applications.

<title>Avoiding Leakage Poisoning: Concept Interventions Under Distribution Shifts</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how concept-based models (CMs) respond to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are interpretable neural architectures that first predict a set of high-level concepts (e.g., stripes, black) and then predict a task label from those concepts. In particular, we study the impact of concept interventions (i.e., operations where a human expert corrects a CM's mispredicted concepts at test time) on CMs' task predictions when inputs are OOD. Our analysis reveals a weakness in current state-of-the-art CMs, which we term leakage poisoning, that prevents them from properly improving their accuracy when intervened on for OOD inputs. To address this, we introduce MixCEM, a new CM that learns to dynamically exploit leaked information missing from its concepts only when this information is in-distribution. Our results across tasks with and without complete sets of concept annotations demonstrate that MixCEMs outperform strong baselines by significantly improving their accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples in the presence and absence of concept interventions.

<title>LZ Penalty: An information-theoretic repetition penalty for autoregressive language models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.

Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.

<title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>

Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems. For an interactive visualization of the framework, see: https://egil158.github.io/cogfoundations-econ/

<title>From Neurons to Computation: Biological Reservoir Computing for Pattern Recognition</title>

arXiv:2505.03510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.

Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate total electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, thus enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, contextual information, and representative time-series examples through extensive case studies. Extensive experiments on the REDD and UK-DALE datasets show that LLMs guided solely by prompts deliver only basic NILM capabilities, with performance that lags behind traditional deep-learning models in complex scenarios. However, the experiments also demonstrate strong generalization across different houses and even regions by simply adapting the injected appliance features. It also provides clear, human-readable explanations for the inferred appliance states. Our findings define the capability boundaries of using prompt-only LLMs for NILM tasks. Their strengths in generalization and explainability present a promising new direction for the field.

Abstract: The convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of AI-based tokens, which are cryptographic assets designed to power decentralized AI platforms and services. This paper provides a comprehensive review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures, token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence, and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective, many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning, and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the intersection of AI and blockchain, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and more grounded approaches as the field continues to evolve.

Abstract: Terahertz single-pixel imaging (THz SPI) has garnered widespread attention for its potential to overcome challenges associated with THz focal plane arrays. However, the inherently long wavelength of THz waves limits imaging resolution, while achieving subwavelength resolution requires harsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a sub-diffraction THz backpropagation SPI technique. We illuminate the object with continuous-wave 0.36-THz radiation ({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m). The transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer and subsequently recorded by a far-field single-pixel detector. An untrained neural network constrained with the physical SPI process iteratively reconstructs the THz images with an ultralow sampling ratio of 1.5625%, significantly reducing the long sampling times. To further suppress the THz diffraction-field effects, a backpropagation SPI from near field to far field is implemented by integrating with a THz physical propagation model into the output layer of the network. Notably, using the thick wafer where THz evanescent field cannot be fully recorded, we achieve a spatial resolution of 118 {\mu}m (~{\lambda}0/7) through backpropagation SPI, thus eliminating the need for ultrathin photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.

Abstract: Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm \citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/saharsamr/Modular-LLM.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of Deep- Thinking Models and chain-of-thought technology, which has become a centralized discussion point in the AI community. However, there is a relative gap in the research on complex video reasoning at present. In this work, we propose CoT-Vid, a novel training-free paradigm for the video domain with a multistage complex reasoning design. Distinguishing from existing video LLMs, which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary models, such as GPT-4V, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-flash. Our codebase will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.

<title>Step-wise Adaptive Integration of Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Task-Specific LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.

<title>Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI community's advancement.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.

<title>medDreamer: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Latent Imagination on Complex EHRs for Clinical Decision Support</title>

arXiv:2505.19785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses can vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these treatment decisions are often irregularly sampled, where missing data frequencies may implicitly convey information about the patient's condition. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) based clinical decision support systems often ignore the missing patterns and distort them with coarse discretization and simple imputation. They are also predominantly model-free and largely depend on retrospective data, which could lead to insufficient exploration and bias by historical behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose medDreamer, a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment recommendation. medDreamer contains a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration module that simulates latent patient states from irregular data and a two-phase policy trained on a hybrid of real and imagined trajectories. This enables learning optimal policies that go beyond the sub-optimality of historical clinical decisions, while remaining close to real clinical data. We evaluate medDreamer on both sepsis and mechanical ventilation treatment tasks using two large-scale Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that medDreamer significantly outperforms model-free and model-based baselines in both clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.

Abstract: Affordance theory suggests that environments inherently provide action possibilities shaping perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce **A4Bench**, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 questionanswer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. We evaluate 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) and compare them to human performance. Results show that proprietary models generally outperform open-source ones, yet all models perform far below humans, especially in transformative affordance. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.

<title>CountingFruit: Language-Guided 3D Fruit Counting with Semantic Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.2\% recall on Fuji-SfM orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.

<title>Leaps Beyond the Seen: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes</title>

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to produce free-text summaries of a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being a representative long-form example. While recent LLM-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from limited patient information. In this paper, we propose ReinRAG, a reinforced reasoning augmented generation (RAG) for long-form discharge instructions based on pre-admission information. ReinRAG retrieves reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph to provide explicit semantic guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose group-based retriever optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with group-normalized rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world dataset show that ReinRAG outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. Further analysis reveals that ReinRAG fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where traditional tools are limited.

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.

Abstract: Continual learning under adversarial conditions remains an open problem, as existing methods often compromise either robustness, scalability, or both. We propose a novel framework that integrates Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) with a hypernetwork-based architecture to enable certifiably robust continual learning across sequential tasks. Our method, SHIELD, generates task-specific model parameters via a shared hypernetwork conditioned solely on compact task embeddings, eliminating the need for replay buffers or full model copies and enabling efficient over time. To further enhance robustness, we introduce Interval MixUp, a novel training strategy that blends virtual examples represented as $\ell_{\infty}$ balls centered around MixUp points. Leveraging interval arithmetic, this technique guarantees certified robustness while mitigating the wrapping effect, resulting in smoother decision boundaries. We evaluate SHIELD under strong white-box adversarial attacks, including PGD and AutoAttack, across multiple benchmarks. It consistently outperforms existing robust continual learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art average accuracy while maintaining both scalability and certification. These results represent a significant step toward practical and theoretically grounded continual learning in adversarial settings.

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is, training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across tasks.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 960 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 8,243 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 25,106 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 19 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents. To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants, eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible guidance during sampling.

arXiv:2506.13298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, and Asian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the original model's output distribution and generative capacity.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic planning.

<title>PRISON: Unmasking the Criminal Potential of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal potential across five traits: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured crime scenarios adapted from classic films grounded in reality, we evaluate both criminal potential and anti-crime ability of LLMs. Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 44% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment, and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

<title>MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning</title>

arXiv:2506.16792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks -- methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version -- order-determining optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets using two open-source and four closed-source models. Results show that MIST achieves competitive attack success rate, relatively low query count, and fair transferability, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct analysis on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

<title>Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19467</link>

Abstract: Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important.

<title>FloorPlan-DeepSeek (FPDS): A multimodal approach to floorplan generation using vector-based next room prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21562</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21562</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction' mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling. Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting future intelligent architectural design.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) plays a crucial role in modern hardware design by transforming high-level code into optimized hardware implementations. However, progress in applying machine learning (ML) to HLS optimization has been hindered by a shortage of sufficiently large and diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce ForgeHLS, a large-scale, open-source dataset explicitly designed for ML-driven HLS research. ForgeHLS comprises over 400k diverse designs generated from 846 kernels covering a broad range of application domains, consuming over 200k CPU hours during dataset construction. Each kernel includes systematically automated pragma insertions (loop unrolling, pipelining, array partitioning), combined with extensive design space exploration using Bayesian optimization. Compared to existing datasets, ForgeHLS significantly enhances scale, diversity, and design coverage. We further define and evaluate representative downstream tasks in Quality of Result (QoR) prediction and automated pragma exploration, clearly demonstrating ForgeHLS utility for developing and improving ML-based HLS optimization methodologies. The dataset and code are public at https://github.com/zedong-peng/ForgeHLS.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/hieuphamha19/CSDS.

arXiv:2507.07024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1) distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference, where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active) on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by 10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into hearing assistance marks a paradigm shift from traditional amplification-based systems to intelligent, context-aware audio processing. This systematic literature review evaluates advances in AI-driven selective noise cancellation (SNC) for hearing aids, highlighting technological evolution, implementation challenges, and future research directions. We synthesize findings across deep learning architectures, hardware deployment strategies, clinical validation studies, and user-centric design. The review traces progress from early machine learning models to state-of-the-art deep networks, including Convolutional Recurrent Networks for real-time inference and Transformer-based architectures for high-accuracy separation. Key findings include significant gains over traditional methods, with recent models achieving up to 18.3 dB SI-SDR improvement on noisy-reverberant benchmarks, alongside sub-10 ms real-time implementations and promising clinical outcomes. Yet, challenges remain in bridging lab-grade models with real-world deployment - particularly around power constraints, environmental variability, and personalization. Identified research gaps include hardware-software co-design, standardized evaluation protocols, and regulatory considerations for AI-enhanced hearing devices. Future work must prioritize lightweight models, continual learning, contextual-based classification and clinical translation to realize transformative hearing solutions for millions globally.

<title>Mitigating Watermark Forgery in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07871</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.07871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret watermarking key. A security threat to GenAI providers are \emph{forgery attacks}, where malicious users insert the provider's watermark into generated content that was \emph{not} produced by the provider's models, potentially damaging their reputation and undermining trust. One potential defense to resist forgery is using multiple keys to watermark generated content. However, it has been shown that forgery attacks remain successful when adversaries can collect sufficiently many watermarked samples. We propose an improved multi-key watermarking method that resists all surveyed forgery attacks and scales independently of the number of watermarked samples collected by the adversary. Our method accepts content as genuinely watermarked only if \emph{exactly} one watermark is detected. We focus on the image and text modalities, but our detection method is modality-agnostic, since it treats the underlying watermarking method as a black-box. We derive theoretical bounds on forgery-resistance and empirically validate them using Mistral-7B. Our results show a decrease in forgery success from up to $100\%$ using single-key baselines to only $2\%$. While our method resists all surveyed attacks, we find that highly capable, adaptive attackers can still achieve success rates of up to $65\%$ if watermarked content generated using different keys is easily separable.

<title>Occlusion-Aware Temporally Consistent Amodal Completion for 3D Human-Object Interaction Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

<title>Clue-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2507.08445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).

arXiv:2507.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent automation becomes an important feature to deal with the increased complexity in managing wireless networks. This paper proposes a novel automation approach of intent-based network for Radio Access Networks (RANs) management by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method enhances intent translation, autonomously interpreting high-level objectives, reasoning over complex network states, and generating precise configurations of the RAN by integrating LLMs within an agentic architecture. We propose a structured prompt engineering technique and demonstrate that the network can automatically improve its energy efficiency by dynamically optimizing critical RAN parameters through a closed-loop mechanism. It showcases the potential to enable robust resource management in RAN by adapting strategies based on real-time feedback via LLM-orchestrated agentic systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning architectures to process and predict sequences of words based on context, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. However, the increasing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying cutting-edge LLMs demand extensive computational resources and large-scale datasets. This creates a significant barrier for researchers and practitioners. Because of that, platforms that host models and datasets have gained widespread popularity. For example, on one of the most popular platforms, i.e., Hugging Face, there are more than 1.8 million models and more than 450K datasets by the end of June 2025, and the trend does not show any slowdown.
  As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pretrained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks better, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to collect LLMs' supply chain information systematically. With the collected information, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a large directed heterogeneous graph having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Then, on top of this graph, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the broad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of large language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters, showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.

Abstract: Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills?
  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs.
  These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.

<title>Combining Cost-Constrained Runtime Monitors for AI Safety</title>

Abstract: Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In this paper, we study how to combine multiple runtime monitors into a single monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall). Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the most efficient protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

<title>Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis</title>

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent preferences of models and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

<title>Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL</title>

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.

Summary:
The article discusses the limitations of HealthBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI systems in healthcare, due to its reliance on expert opinion and potential biases. It highlights the challenges faced in low- and middle-income settings, particularly in the African context, and calls for more globally relevant benchmarks. The proposed solution involves anchoring reward functions in version-controlled Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), incorporating systematic reviews and GRADE evidence ratings. The roadmap includes evidence-robust reinforcement learning, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override logic, emphasizing ethical considerations and delayed outcome feedback integration. By linking rewards to rigorously vetted CPGs, the goal is to develop medical language models that are linguistically polished, clinically trustworthy, ethically sound, and globally relevant. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: HealthBench, a benchmark designed to measure the capabilities of AI systems for health better (Arora et al., 2025), has advanced medical language model evaluation through physician-crafted dialogues and transparent rubrics. However, its reliance on expert opinion, rather than high-tier clinical evidence, risks codifying regional biases and individual clinician idiosyncrasies, further compounded by potential biases in automated grading systems. These limitations are particularly magnified in low- and middle-income settings, where issues like sparse neglected tropical disease coverage and region-specific guideline mismatches are prevalent.
  The unique challenges of the African context, including data scarcity, inadequate infrastructure, and nascent regulatory frameworks, underscore the urgent need for more globally relevant and equitable benchmarks. To address these shortcomings, we propose anchoring reward functions in version-controlled Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that incorporate systematic reviews and GRADE evidence ratings.
  Our roadmap outlines "evidence-robust" reinforcement learning via rubric-to-guideline linkage, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override logic, complemented by a focus on ethical considerations and the integration of delayed outcome feedback. By re-grounding rewards in rigorously vetted CPGs, while preserving HealthBench's transparency and physician engagement, we aim to foster medical language models that are not only linguistically polished but also clinically trustworthy, ethically sound, and globally relevant.

The paper introduces Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) as a formal specification language for security, opacity, and concurrency properties in robotics applications. It addresses the research gap in security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing a SecRL approach that combines HyperTWTL constraints with dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL. The method aims to learn security-aware optimal policies while satisfying HyperTWTL constraints in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework.

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms, showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

Summary:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly impacting various aspects of our lives, including work, interactions, business, and research. However, applying AI successfully in industrial settings with a focus on end-to-end operational processes poses challenges for organizations. The paper discusses generative, predictive, and prescriptive AI and emphasizes the importance of Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) in grounding AI applications. OCPM serves as the missing link that connects data and processes in an organization-specific and structured manner, enabling different forms of AI. The concept of Process Intelligence (PI) is introduced to encompass process-centric data-driven techniques capable of handling various object and event types in an organizational context. The paper underscores the necessity of PI in improving operational processes and highlights the potential for effectively integrating OCPM with generative, predictive, and prescriptive AI methodologies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact, do business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI successfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end operational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and prescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving such processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and organization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic. OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different forms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the amalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a variety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context. This paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and highlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative, predictive, and prescriptive AI.

Summary: 
Rank reversals in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis can significantly impact the results of decision-making methods. This paper introduces three tests implemented in the Scikit-Criteria library to detect Rank Reversals and evaluate method performance on a set of alternatives. The tests address challenges in implementing detection methods for various scenarios and discuss design considerations to overcome them. By enabling the evaluation of different methods' effectiveness in solving problems, these tests can play a crucial role in assessing multi-criteria decision methods. <div>

Abstract: In Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Rank Reversals are a serious problem that can greatly affect the results of a Multi-Criteria Decision Method against a particular set of alternatives. It is therefore useful to have a mechanism that allows one to measure the performance of a method on a set of alternatives. This idea could be taken further to build a global ranking of the effectiveness of different methods to solve a problem. In this paper, we present three tests that detect the presence of Rank Reversals, along with their implementation in the Scikit-Criteria library. We also address the complications that arise when implementing these tests for general scenarios and the design considerations we made to handle them. We close with a discussion about how these additions could play a major role in the judgment of multi-criteria decision methods for problem solving.

Summary:
SHACL, a standardized constraint language for RDF graphs, is the focus of this study on validation under updates. The research introduces a SHACL-based update language to facilitate realistic modifications on RDF graphs. The primary objective is to determine if graphs that conform to SHACL specifications remain valid after undergoing a sequence of updates. By incorporating update actions into SHACL constraints, the study establishes that static validation under updates can be simplified to evaluating constraints in SHACL. The computational complexity of the static validation problem for SHACL and its fragments is thoroughly analyzed. A prototype implementation for static validation and other analysis tasks on SHACL constraints is also presented, alongside preliminary experimental results showcasing its functionality. This research lays the foundation for services designed to reason about evolving RDF graphs.

Abstract: SHACL (SHApe Constraint Language) is a W3C standardized constraint language for RDF graphs. In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under updates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive and realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static validation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph that validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given update sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for reasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds the update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under updates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor extension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static validation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a prototype implementation that performs static validation and other static analysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through preliminary experiments.

Abstract: Despite efforts to mitigate the inherent risks and biases of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these algorithms can disproportionately impact culturally marginalized groups. A range of approaches has been proposed to address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design, co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.

Abstract: Humans can be notoriously imperfect evaluators. They are often biased, unreliable, and unfit to define "ground truth." Yet, given the surging need to produce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI, traditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain central to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine learning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification of tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded assessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a gatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways that are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address this issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods, such as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and close-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better position to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved student learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We also emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by establishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it works across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call on the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing validity and educational impact over consensus alone.

- An objective function is designed to represent human power, considering various goals and social norms.  
- Algorithms are derived for computing this metric using reinforcement learning.  
- Softly maximizing human power could be a safer objective for AI systems compared to utility-based objectives.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.

Summary:
RL-PLUS is a novel approach that combines internal exploitation and external data to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models beyond their inherent limits. By utilizing Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch and an Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards valuable reasoning paths, RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance on various math reasoning benchmarks and out-of-distribution tasks. The approach yields significant improvements across different model families, with average relative gains ranging from 21.1% to 69.2%. Furthermore, RL-PLUS effectively mitigates the capability boundary collapse issue, as evidenced by the Pass@k curves on multiple benchmarks. This innovative method enhances the problem-solving scope of Large Language Models, showcasing the potential for improved reasoning abilities in complex tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

<div> Keywords: MetaAgent, learning-by-doing, natural language help requests, meta tool learning, knowledge discovery 

Summary: 
MetaAgent is a novel agentic paradigm that focuses on learning-by-doing to develop expertise through hands-on practice and self-improvement. It begins with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities, utilizing natural language help requests to bridge knowledge gaps. A dedicated tool router routes these requests to appropriate external tools, and MetaAgent reflects on its actions, incorporating experience into future tasks. Through meta tool learning, it incrementally refines reasoning and tool-use strategies without model parameter adjustments. By organizing tool-use history, MetaAgent autonomously builds tools and a knowledge base, improving information retrieval and integration. Evaluation on challenging knowledge discovery tasks shows MetaAgent surpasses workflow-based models and rivals end-to-end trained agents, showcasing its potential for robust, versatile knowledge discovery. Source codes are available on GitHub: https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

<div> Keywords: task generation, large language models, psychological drivers, human cognition, intrinsic motivation <br />
Summary: <br />
The study compares human task generation with that of a large language model (LLM) agent (GPT-4o). Human task generation is influenced by personal values and cognitive style, while the LLM fails to reflect these patterns even when provided with the same psychological drivers. The LLM's tasks are less social, less physical, and biased toward abstraction, showing a disconnect between linguistic proficiency and generating human-like goals. Despite being perceived as more fun and novel, the LLM lacks the embodied, value-driven nature of human cognition. The study concludes that incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding is necessary to design more human-aligned agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.

<div> Evaluation, Visual Language Models, Graphic Reasoning, ReasonBench, Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain, ReasonTune

Summary:
ReasonBench introduces a new evaluation benchmark for visual language models, focusing on complex graphic reasoning tasks. It includes over 1,600 questions from real-world intelligence tests covering various reasoning dimensions. The benchmark evaluates the performance of 11 mainstream VLMs and highlights significant limitations in their spatial, relational, and abstract reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, the authors propose a dual optimization strategy. The Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances interpretability by decomposing layers, while ReasonTune improves task adaptability through training, resulting in a 33.5% improvement in VLM performance. The experimental data and code are available in a public repository. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in graphic reasoning tasks has become an important research topic. However, VLMs still show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of current models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual optimization strategy: Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances the interpretability of reasoning by decomposing layers, and ReasonTune enhances the task adaptability of model reasoning through training, all of which improves VLM performance by 33.5\%. All experimental data and code are in the repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cistine/ReasonBench.

Summary:
The article discusses the safety risks associated with large reasoning models (LRMs) and proposes a solution called R1-Act to improve safety while maintaining reasoning performance. The study finds that LRMs already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail to activate it during reasoning. R1-Act is a post-training method that triggers safety knowledge through a structured reasoning process, outperforming previous alignment methods. The method requires minimal training examples and training time on a single GPU. Extensive experiments using various LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of R1-Act in improving safety in reasoning models. <div>

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90 minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and practical efficiency of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-Thought prompting, reasoning, vision-language models, visual verification, multimodal reasoning 

Summary: 
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been effective in improving reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) but often lacks grounding in visual content. To address this, the CoRGI framework introduces visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage pipeline involving generating a textual reasoning chain, extracting visual evidence for each step, and synthesizing the rationale with visual evidence to produce a grounded answer. Evaluations on the VCR benchmark show improved reasoning performance with CoRGI on existing VLM backbones. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the verification module, and human evaluations indicate more factual and helpful explanations. The study also discusses alternative designs for visual verification and highlights the significance of grounding reasoning steps in visual evidence for enhanced multimodal reasoning.

arXiv:2508.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module (VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

<div> ToM, multi-agent cooperation, active inference, collision avoidance, foraging task <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This article introduces a new approach to multi-agent cooperation by incorporating theory of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM allows agents to understand others' beliefs and goals, enabling better coordination without the need for shared generative models or explicit communication. In this framework, agents maintain separate representations of their own and others' beliefs and goals and utilize sophisticated planning algorithms to explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Through simulations of collision avoidance and foraging tasks, the ToM-equipped agents demonstrate improved cooperation by avoiding collisions and reducing redundant efforts, all while inferring others' beliefs from observable behavior. This research contributes to advancements in artificial intelligence applications and offers valuable computational insights into theory of mind. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication, while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts. Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents.

Summary:
The article discusses the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in structured reasoning, particularly in coding and mathematics. It examines the challenges in applying LLMs to formal mathematics, despite their success in informal problem-solving. The trade-offs between formal and informal mathematics as training domains are highlighted, as well as the reasons why proof generation is more difficult than code synthesis. The article also explores the question of whether LLMs truly represent a notion of evolving logical state or simply mimic it. The current limits of LLMs in mathematical cognition are identified, and potential ways to extend these limits are considered. Overall, the article sheds light on the complexities of integrating machine learning with mathematical reasoning and provides insight into future directions for research in this field.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving. However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs ``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks, and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie, and how they might be extended.

<div> proactive, runtime enforcement, reachability analysis, probabilistic, safety<br />
<br />
Summary: Pro2Guard is a proactive runtime enforcement framework designed to address the limitations of existing rule-based systems in managing risks associated with Large Language Model agents. By abstracting agent behaviors into symbolic states and utilizing probabilistic reachability analysis, Pro2Guard can anticipate future safety risks and trigger interventions before violations occur. The framework learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain from execution traces and incorporates semantic validity checks to ensure statistical reliability. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard can enforce safety early on and balance safety with task success through configurable modes. In autonomous driving scenarios, the framework accurately predicts traffic law violations and collisions up to 38.66 seconds in advance. This approach enhances safety measures in domains like robotics and autonomous vehicles where stochastic behavior of agents poses significant risks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation. However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.

<div> interpretability, multimodal AI models, cross-modal interactions, MultiSHAP, Shapley Interaction Index

Summary: 
MultiSHAP is a model-agnostic interpretability framework designed to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models. It leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute predictions to pairwise interactions between visual and textual elements. The framework provides instance-level explanations to understand why a specific prediction is made on an input, and dataset-level explanations to uncover general interaction patterns across samples. It can reveal synergistic and suppressive effects between modalities, offering insights into how information is integrated. Experiments on public benchmarks show that MultiSHAP accurately captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, and real-world case studies demonstrate its practical utility. The framework is extendable to more than two modalities, providing a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal AI models. <div>
arXiv:2508.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and language. However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input", and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal AI models.

Abstract: Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery. However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex, voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task, particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus; Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage, diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its practical potential to enhance patient information collection.

Summary:
AI has shown proficiency in generating various types of content, but creating interactive audio-visual content like video games remains a challenge. The authors of this paper introduce AVR-Eval, a metric for evaluating multimedia content quality using Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). They also present AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system that generates JavaScript code for games and animations using a combination of assets such as audio, images, and 3D models. Experiments showed that content produced by AVR-Agent outperforms one-shot generated content in terms of quality. However, there is a gap in the model's ability to effectively utilize custom assets and feedback from AVRs, highlighting differences between human and machine approaches to content creation. This research emphasizes the importance of incorporating high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback for enhancing machine-generated content. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging. Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video, and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However, models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

<title>Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies</title>

<div> Keywords: Granger causality, time series, variable-lag, multi-band, frequency-dependent

Summary:
The article introduces Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC), a new framework that extends traditional Granger causality to incorporate frequency-dependent causal delays in time series analysis. Traditional Granger causality assumes a fixed time lag between cause and effect, which may not capture the complexities of real-world systems. The MB-VLGC framework allows for varying time delays and frequency bands in causal interactions, making it more versatile and applicable to a wide range of fields such as neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. The formal definition and theoretical soundness of MB-VLGC are presented, along with an efficient inference pipeline. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MB-VLGC compared to existing methods. The code and datasets used in the study are openly available for further research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Summary: 
Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems in education lack transparency in decision-making processes. Traditional explainable AI techniques often overlook user roles and comprehension. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that combines traditional XAI methods with generative AI models and user personalization to create personalized explanations tailored to individual user needs. By redefining explainability as a dynamic communication process customized to user roles and learning objectives, the framework aims to enhance transparency and support user-centered learning experiences. The paper discusses the design of the framework, highlights key limitations of XAI in education, and suggests future research directions focusing on accuracy, fairness, and personalization. The ultimate goal is to advance towards explainable AI that not only provides transparency but also enriches user understanding and engagement in the learning process.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping education through data-driven adaptation of learning experiences. Yet many of these systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions are made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design, key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy, fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

<div> Keywords: social media, AI recommendations, explainability, user segmentation, visual explanation<br />
Summary:<br />
Social media platforms are increasingly relying on AI recommendations to enhance user experience. However, the lack of explainability behind these recommendations diminishes their value to users. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer that utilizes diverse visual explanation methods. By tailoring explanations to different user needs and contexts, the system offers varying levels of technical detail for both AI experts and lay users. The framework is unique in its ability to adapt explanation styles (visual vs. numeric) and granularity (expert vs. lay) within a single pipeline. A forthcoming public pilot involving 30 users aims to validate the system's impact on decision-making and trust. <div>

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity (expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

Summary: 
- The article discusses the need for robust fake detectors due to the spread of deepfakes created using generative models.
- Existing fake detectors struggle to generalize across different generators and data types.
- The authors propose using large pre-trained multi-modal models to detect generative content effectively.
- They show that the latent code of these models naturally distinguishes between real and fake information.
- Linear classifiers trained on these features achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting fake content in audio and images, outperforming strong baseline methods.

Abstract: Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains, including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content. Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images, achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline methods.

Abstract: Indonesia is rich in languages and scripts. However, most NLP progress has been made using romanized text. In this paper, we present NusaAksara, a novel public benchmark for Indonesian languages that includes their original scripts. Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse tasks such as image segmentation, OCR, transliteration, translation, and language identification. Our data is constructed by human experts through rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although unsupported by Unicode, the Lampung script is included in this dataset. We benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia's local scripts, with many achieving near-zero performance.

Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of "Hypertextual Friction" as a design stance that emphasizes the values of friction, traceability, and structure in reclaiming user agency in algorithm-driven interfaces. Through a comparative analysis of real-world systems like Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore and Are.na vs. GenAI image tools, the study highlights how hypertext systems prioritize provenance, associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems tend to obscure processes and limit user participation. The analysis demonstrates how interface structures shape agency in user-driven versus agent-driven systems, showing the importance of repositioning classical hypertext principles as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an increasingly algorithmic web.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed. This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation, and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance, associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an increasingly algorithmic web.

<div> Keywords: program synthesis, combinatorial search, constraints, syntactic constraints, program space enumeration

Summary: 
Program synthesis faces a major challenge in navigating the vast space of possible programs. To address this challenge, researchers have turned to using combinatorial constraint solvers. However, the focus has traditionally been on using constraints to express program semantics rather than to filter out unwanted programs. Recent advancements in inductive logic programming have introduced syntactic constraints to guide the synthesis process. By leveraging these syntactic constraints to model program spaces, researchers have been able to define not only feasible solutions but also those that are likely to be useful. The introduction of the BART solver, which efficiently propagates and solves these constraints, has shown promising results in eliminating a significant portion of the program space and reducing enumeration time. Leveraging syntactic constraints in program synthesis offers a new approach to streamlining the process and generating more effective solutions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A core challenge in program synthesis is taming the large space of possible programs. Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the community has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers. Here, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a potentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic programming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be synthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a constraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In this work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining not just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To demonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates and solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration tasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program space, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time.

Abstract: With the development of large models and autonomous decision-making AI, agents are rapidly becoming the new entities of the internet, following mobile apps. However, existing internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human interaction, creating data silos, unfriendly interfaces, and high collaboration costs among agents, making it difficult to support the needs for large-scale agent interconnection and collaboration. The internet is undergoing a profound transformation, showing four core trends: agents replacing traditional software, universal agent interconnection, native protocol-based connections, and autonomous agent organization and collaboration. To align with these trends, Agent Network Protocol (ANP) proposes a new generation of communication protocols for the Agentic Web. ANP adheres to AI-native design, maintains compatibility with existing internet protocols, adopts a modular composable architecture, follows minimalist yet extensible principles, and enables rapid deployment based on existing infrastructure. Through a three-layer protocol system--identity and encrypted communication layer, meta-protocol negotiation layer, and application protocol layer--ANP. systematically solves the problems of agent identity authentication, dynamic negotiation, and capability discovery interoperability.

Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the 6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination. The findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with DDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in platoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.

Summary: 
Generative Logic (GL) is a deterministic architecture that explores deductive reasoning based on user-defined axiomatic definitions using a minimalist Mathematical Programming Language (MPL). By compiling definitions into Logic Blocks (LBs) that communicate with each other, GL systematically generates machine-checkable proofs of foundational arithmetic laws such as addition and multiplication properties in Peano arithmetic. The software implementation allows for the examination of each inference step independently in navigable HTML proof graphs. The project outlines plans for hardware-software co-design for parallel realization and proposes integration with probabilistic models for autoformalization and conjecture seeding. The Python and MPL code, along with the HTML proof graphs, are publicly available for replication and further collaboration. Feedback and contributions from the community are encouraged for the advancement of Generative Logic. <div>

Abstract: We present Generative Logic (GL), a deterministic architecture that begins from user-supplied axiomatic definitions -- written in a minimalist Mathematical Programming Language (MPL) -- and systematically explores their deductive neighborhood. Definitions are compiled into a distributed grid of simple Logic Blocks (LBs) that exchange messages; any time several expressions unify under an inference rule, a new fact is emitted with full provenance to its sources, yielding replayable, auditable proof graphs.
  A prototype software implementation instantiates the workflow on first-order Peano arithmetic. Starting only from the Peano axioms, GL enumerates candidate implications, applies normalization and type filters, and automatically reconstructs machine-checkable proofs of foundational arithmetic laws including associativity and commutativity of addition, associativity and commutativity of multiplication, and distributivity. Generated proofs export to navigable HTML so that every inference step can be inspected independently.
  We outline a hardware-software co-design path toward massively parallel realizations and describe prospective integration with probabilistic models (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) for autoformalization and conjecture seeding. The Python and MPL code to reproduce the Peano experiments, along with the full HTML proof graphs, are available in the project's GitHub repository at https://github.com/Generative-Logic/GL/tree/35a111ea9ba53afe051703d6050be0c3923e9724 and are permanently archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16408441.

Summary: 
Quantum Support Vector Machines (SVMs) encounter challenges with scalability due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. In this study, a novel approach is proposed that integrates class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings in a quantum-classical pipeline. The research demonstrates that Vision Transformer (ViT) embeddings offer unique advantages, leading to accuracy improvements of up to 8.02% on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST compared to classical SVMs. Interestingly, convolutional neural network (CNN) features show performance degradation in comparison. By employing a 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, the study provides compelling evidence that the quantum kernel advantage is closely tied to the choice of embeddings. This highlights the fundamental synergy between transformer attention mechanisms and quantum feature spaces, offering a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that harnesses the capabilities of modern neural architectures.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Summary:
The paper presents a scalable framework for predicting spectrum availability by combining a two-state Markov chain model of primary user activity with ITU-R propagation models. The Markov chain captures temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models consider path loss and clutter effects to determine interference thresholds at secondary user locations. The integrated approach can predict spectrum opportunities in time and space with improved accuracy. The framework is flexible and adaptable to various scenarios and frequency bands. Results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in identifying available spectrum with low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in cognitive radio networks and dynamic spectrum sharing systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R (specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach, analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions, limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly as tools for automating code generation in scientific research, yet their ability to interpret and use unfamiliar Python APIs for complex computational experiments remains poorly characterized. This study systematically benchmarks a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating functional Python code for two increasingly challenging scenarios: conversational data analysis with the \textit{ParShift} library, and synthetic data generation and clustering using \textit{pyclugen} and \textit{scikit-learn}. Both experiments use structured, zero-shot prompts specifying detailed requirements but omitting in-context examples. Model outputs are evaluated quantitatively for functional correctness and prompt compliance over multiple runs, and qualitatively by analyzing the errors produced when code execution fails. Results show that only a small subset of models consistently generate correct, executable code, with GPT-4.1 standing out as the only model to always succeed in both tasks. In addition to benchmarking LLM performance, this approach helps identify shortcomings in third-party libraries, such as unclear documentation or obscure implementation bugs. Overall, these findings highlight current limitations of LLMs for end-to-end scientific automation and emphasize the need for careful prompt design, comprehensive library documentation, and continued advances in language model capabilities.

Summary:<br />
The paper focuses on developing a data-driven predictive model, ScaleSTF, for forecasting spatiotemporal dynamics in urban systems. Traditional models like graph neural networks face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency in large-scale networks due to computational demands. To address this challenge, the proposed ScaleSTF draws inspiration from physical laws and employs a principled interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures. By understanding micro- and macro-processes, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability with linear complexity. Validated on urban systems such as traffic flow, solar power, and smart meters, ScaleSTF provides a fresh perspective on dynamics prediction in large-scale urban networks. <div>

Abstract: Networked urban systems facilitate the flow of people, resources, and services, and are essential for economic and social interactions. These systems often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability. Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in large-scale urban networks.

Abstract: Hump crossings, or high-profile Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs), pose safety risks to highway vehicles due to potential hang-ups. These crossings typically result from post-construction railway track maintenance activities or non-compliance with design guidelines for HRGC vertical alignments. Conventional methods for measuring HRGC profiles are costly, time-consuming, traffic-disruptive, and present safety challenges. To address these issues, this research employed advanced, cost-effective techniques and innovative modeling approaches for HRGC profile measurement. A novel hybrid deep learning framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures was developed by utilizing instrumentation and ground truth data. Instrumentation data were gathered using a highway testing vehicle equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors, while ground truth data were obtained via an industrial-standard walking profiler. Field data was collected at the Red Rock Railroad Corridor in Oklahoma. Three advanced deep learning models Transformer-LSTM sequential (model 1), LSTM-Transformer sequential (model 2), and LSTM-Transformer parallel (model 3) were evaluated to identify the most efficient architecture. Models 2 and 3 outperformed the others and were deployed to generate 2D/3D HRGC profiles. The deep learning models demonstrated significant potential to enhance highway and railroad safety by enabling rapid and accurate assessment of HRGC hang-up susceptibility.

<div> Keywords: Federated fine-tuning, Large Language Models, Developmental Federated Tuning, resource-efficient, cognitive development

Summary:
Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT) introduces a resource-efficient approach inspired by cognitive development for Large Language Models (LLMs). DevFT decomposes fine-tuning into stages, optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity and transferring knowledge between stages for optimized initialization. This progressive approach mirrors human learning, gradually building a powerful LLM while refining skills. DevFT utilizes deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to construct representative layers efficiently. Evaluations show that DevFT outperforms existing methods with faster convergence, reduced communication overhead, and performance improvement. With up to 4.59× faster convergence, 10.67× less communication overhead, and 9.07% average performance boost, DevFT offers a promising solution for deploying LLMs on edge devices. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks while preserving data privacy, but its resource-intensive nature limits deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT), a resource-efficient approach inspired by cognitive development that progressively builds a powerful LLM from a compact foundation. DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into developmental stages, each optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge from earlier stages transfers to subsequent submodels, providing optimized initialization parameters that prevent convergence to local minima and accelerate training. This paradigm mirrors human learning, gradually constructing comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills. To efficiently build stage-specific submodels, DevFT introduces deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to distill essential information and construct representative layers. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DevFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.59$\times$ faster convergence, 10.67$\times$ reduction in communication overhead, and 9.07% average performance improvement, while maintaining compatibility with existing approaches.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of addressing partial observability in reinforcement learning algorithms and the need for comprehensive benchmarks to measure progress. It emphasizes the significance of evaluating algorithms on benchmarks that accurately represent the various forms of partial observability encountered in real-world scenarios, such as visual occlusion and unknown opponent intent. The proposed benchmark should have coverage in different forms of partial observability and showcase a significant performance gap between agents with varying levels of state information. The article introduces best-practice guidelines for benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial observability and presents the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable Benchmarks in JAX. Various environments representing partial observability, including localization and mapping, visual control, and games, are identified as memory improvable and requiring complex memory functions for effective learning. The framework includes recommended hyperparameters and algorithm implementations for efficient evaluation and experimentation using JAX for GPU scalability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present in various environments and select representative environments for our benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control, games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for GPU-scalable experimentation.

<div> Keywords: Time-series anomaly detection, Large Language Models, Tri-Branch Patch-wise Framework, Unsupervised learning, Benchmark datasets <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach called TriP-LLM for time-series anomaly detection, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework integrates local and global temporal features using a tri-branch design and patch-wise token encoding to process input time series data. The TriP-LLM model outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior anomaly detection capabilities. The use of LLMs in the architecture is shown to be crucial through extensive ablation studies. The framework also offers improved memory efficiency compared to other LLM-based approaches, making it suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. The code and model checkpoints are openly available on GitHub for further exploration and use. <div>

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git

Summary:This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM regression model and genetic algorithm optimization to evaluate the impact of COVID-19-related indicators on Bitcoin return prediction. The research focused on determining the significance of pandemic-related health data in improving prediction accuracy rather than solely forecasting Bitcoin returns. A comprehensive dataset was constructed, incorporating daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics such as vaccination rates, hospitalizations, and testing statistics. Results showed that including COVID-19 indicators significantly enhanced model performance, particularly in capturing extreme market fluctuations. Vaccination metrics, particularly the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, were identified as dominant predictors. The proposed methodology offers an extension to financial analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing refined indicators for investors and policymakers to navigate market uncertainty during systemic crises.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM regression model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to systematically evaluate the contribution of COVID-19-related indicators to Bitcoin return prediction. The primary objective was not merely to forecast Bitcoin returns but rather to determine whether including pandemic-related health data significantly enhances prediction accuracy. A comprehensive dataset comprising daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates, hospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models, trained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31 independent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and Mann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators significantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme market fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly significant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics, especially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as dominant predictors. The proposed methodology extends existing financial analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing investors and policymakers with refined indicators to navigate market uncertainty during systemic crises.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.

Summary: 
Multimodal action recognition models are evaluated on three datasets to explore their ability to transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts. The study finds that these models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions compared to coarse actions. The synthetic dataset proves to be as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings. Larger models show improved transferability when spatial cues are dominant but struggle with intense temporal reasoning. Additionally, reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. Disentangling coarse and fine motions is found to improve recognition in temporally challenging datasets. This study establishes a benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action recognition. <div>

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2) Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action recognition. Datasets and relevant code: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/Motion-Transfer.

This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a novel approach to neural network training that adapts optimization behavior based on the concepts of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic) Deformation, inspired by material science. The proposed Plastic Deformation Optimizer injects adaptive noise into model parameters to address persistent optimization challenges indicated by internal stress signals. This allows the model to move away from sharp minima and towards more generalizable regions of the loss landscape. Experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic) Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers, and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) aims to enhance learning experiences through technologies like Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), offering personalized learning, increased engagement, and improved retention rates. However, AIED faces three main challenges: the critical role of teachers in the design process, the limitations and reliability of AI tools, and the accessibility of technological resources. Augmented Intelligence (AuI) addresses these challenges by enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them, allowing systems to suggest solutions. In contrast, humans provide final assessments, thus improving AI over time. In this sense, this study focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating MathAIde, an ITS that corrects mathematics exercises using computer vision and AI and provides feedback based on photos of student work. The methodology included brainstorming sessions with potential users, high-fidelity prototyping, A/B testing, and a case study involving real-world classroom environments for teachers and students. Our research identified several design possibilities for implementing AuI in ITSs, emphasizing a balance between user needs and technological feasibility. Prioritization and validation through prototyping and testing highlighted the importance of efficiency metrics, ultimately leading to a solution that offers pre-defined remediation alternatives for teachers. Real-world deployment demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed solution. Our research contributes to the literature by providing a usable, teacher-centered design approach that involves teachers in all design phases. As a practical implication, we highlight that the user-centered design approach increases the usefulness and adoption potential of AIED systems, especially in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Liver diseases are a serious health concern in the world, which requires precise and timely diagnosis to enhance the survival chances of patients. The current literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning models to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high misclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational expense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these drawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked ensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses advanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model robustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal with class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an ensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose complementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided model demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%, Cohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and efficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice (training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate transparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high concentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important observations of liver disease. Also, SHAP was used to rank features by their global contribution to predictions, while the Morris method confirmed the most influential features through sensitivity analysis.

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields, including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising. Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters (7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical application in domains such as security and surveillance.

<title>Your Model Is Unfair, Are You Even Aware? Inverse Relationship Between Comprehension and Trust in Explainability Visualizations of Biased ML Models</title>

Abstract: Systems relying on ML have become ubiquitous, but so has biased behavior within them. Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders' trust in systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different backgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models' behavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey explainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics. We conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools (LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how taxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for non-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between comprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they trust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is strongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations increase people's perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces trust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability visualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show that visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension, increase perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model bias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design, significantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work advances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically investigates visualization's role in facilitating responsible ML applications.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycling volume estimation is essential for sustainable urban transportation planning. However, many cities face significant challenges of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network, comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments (99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and maximize volume estimation accuracy and reliability of bicycling data for informed transportation planning decisions.

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance, averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We provide the implementation and dataset at https://github.com/tomek1911/GEPAR3D.

Abstract: Many existing AI music generation tools rely on text prompts, complex interfaces, or instrument-like controls, which may require musical or technical knowledge that non-musicians do not possess. This paper introduces DeformTune, a prototype system that combines a tactile deformable interface with the MeasureVAE model to explore more intuitive, embodied, and explainable AI interaction. We conducted a preliminary study with 11 adult participants without formal musical training to investigate their experience with AI-assisted music creation. Thematic analysis of their feedback revealed recurring challenge--including unclear control mappings, limited expressive range, and the need for guidance throughout use. We discuss several design opportunities for enhancing explainability of AI, including multimodal feedback and progressive interaction support. These findings contribute early insights toward making AI music systems more explainable and empowering for novice users.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in software development workflows, questions persist about their true impact on developer productivity and experience. This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods study examining how developers perceive AI's influence across the dimensions of the SPACE framework: Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Collaboration and Efficiency. Drawing on survey responses from over 500 developers and qualitative insights from interviews and observational studies, we find that AI is broadly adopted and widely seen as enhancing productivity, particularly for routine tasks. However, the benefits vary, depending on task complexity, individual usage patterns, and team-level adoption. Developers report increased efficiency and satisfaction, with less evidence of impact on collaboration. Organizational support and peer learning play key roles in maximizing AI's value. These findings suggest that AI is augmenting developers rather than replacing them, and that effective integration depends as much on team culture and support structures as on the tools themselves. We conclude with practical recommendations for teams, organizations and researchers seeking to harness AI's potential in software engineering.

Abstract: Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning, often caused by the small batch sizes typically used in this regime, can destabilize training by introducing large oscillations in generation quality. A popular approach to mitigating this instability is to take an Exponential moving average (EMA) of weights throughout training. While EMA reduces stochasticity, thereby smoothing training, the introduction of bias from old iterates often creates a lag in optimization relative to vanilla training. In this work, we propose the Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA), a simple and practical augmentation of EMA that retains variance-reduction benefits while eliminating bias. BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate provable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training. Through an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA leads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over both EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making BEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper, following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually. An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units: (1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing units.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.

<title>Weakly Supervised Intracranial Aneurysm Detection and Segmentation in MR angiography via Multi-task UNet with Vesselness Prior</title>

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and moral beliefs.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to create art, stakeholders cannot come to an agreement on the value of these works. In this study we uncovered the mixed opinions surrounding art made by AI. We developed two versions of a dance performance augmented by technology either with or without GenAI. For each version we informed audiences of the performance's development either before or after a survey on their perceptions of the performance. There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female) divided between the four performances. Results demonstrated that individuals were more inclined to attribute artistic merit to works made by GenAI when they were unaware of its use. We present this case study as a call to address the importance of utilizing the social context and the users' interpretations of GenAI in shaping a technical explanation, leading to a greater discussion that can bridge gaps in understanding.

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark, gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents. We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

Abstract: Graph model generation from natural language description is an important task with many applications in software engineering. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model generation. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces partially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax violations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its metamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not conform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the inherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated elements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as constraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed. Motivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel abstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality of generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our approach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all candidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate concrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for model generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize communications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel delivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.

Abstract: We advance a general theory of coherent preference that surrenders restrictions embodied in orthodox doctrine. This theory enjoys the property that any preference system admits extension to a complete system of preferences, provided it satisfies a certain coherence requirement analogous to the one de Finetti advanced for his foundations of probability. Unlike de Finetti's theory, the one we set forth requires neither transitivity nor Archimedeanness nor boundedness nor continuity of preference. This theory also enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals. Representability by utility is a corollary of this paper's central result, which at once extends H\"older's Theorem and strengthens Hahn's Embedding Theorem.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Explanations are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems, but a gap often exists between the explanations provided by models and those needed by users. To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation frameworks. Our results show high performance across all stages, with a 59.06% F1-score in question reframing, 70% faithfulness in model explanations, and 67% context-utilization in natural language synthesis. User studies corroborate these findings, highlighting the creativity and comprehensiveness of generated explanations. Tested on the Diabetes (PIMA Indian) tabular dataset, MetaExplainer supports diverse explanation types, including Contrastive, Counterfactual, Rationale, Case-Based, and Data explanations. The framework's versatility and traceability from using ontology to guide LLMs suggest broad applicability beyond the tested scenarios, positioning MetaExplainer as a promising tool for enhancing AI explainability across various domains.

<title>Beamformed 360{\deg} Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization</title>

Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Abstract: Nowadays machine learning (ML) practitioners have access to numerous ML libraries available online. Such libraries can be used to create ML pipelines that consist of a series of steps where each step may invoke up to several ML libraries that are used for various data-driven analytical tasks. Development of high-quality ML pipelines is non-trivial; it requires training, ML expertise, and careful development of each step. At the same time, domain experts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and training while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper, we present our ExeKGLib, a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface layer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This is achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple terms accessible to non-ML experts. ExeKGLib also allows improving the transparency and reusability of the built ML workflows and ensures that they are executable. We show the usability and usefulness of ExeKGLib by presenting real use cases.

<title>Decouple before Align: Visual Disentanglement Enhances Prompt Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00395</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm, has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality. Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the visual modality into the foreground and background representation via exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns, directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

<title>DC-AE 1.5: Accelerating Diffusion Model Convergence with Structured Latent Space</title>

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code: https://github.com/dc-ai-projects/DC-Gen.

<title>Contact-Aware Amodal Completion for Human-Object Interaction via Multi-Regional Inpainting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions: the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

<title>Reducing the gap between general purpose data and aerial images in concentrated solar power plants</title>

arXiv:2508.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at https://mpcutino.github.io/aerialcsp/.

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications, such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2 improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS models.

<title>When Relevance Meets Novelty: Dual-Stable Periodic Optimization for Exploratory Recommendation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems tend to trap users in strong feedback loops by excessively pushing content aligned with their historical preferences, thereby limiting exploration opportunities and causing content fatigue. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential with their diverse content generation capabilities, existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks face two major limitations: first, they overlook long-term preferences driven by group identity, leading to biased interest modeling; second, they suffer from static optimization flaws, as a one-time alignment process fails to leverage incremental user data for closed-loop optimization. To address these challenges, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. For interest modeling bias, we introduce Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE) module, jointly modeling long-term group identity and short-term individual interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences. For static optimization limitations, we design a Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO) mechanism. This mechanism regularly conducts preference verification on incremental data using the Relevance LLM, then guides the Novelty LLM to perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, and subsequently feeds back the output of the incrementally fine-tuned Novelty LLM to the Relevance LLM for re-evaluation, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization. Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA model in exploratory recommendation.

Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations. We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence, limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains, however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in unstructured scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation, they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening, detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans; and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5% in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening.

Abstract: A classic account of the quantification of semantic information is that of Bar-Hiller and Carnap. Their account proposes an inverse relation between the informativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach assigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a distance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox. Unfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.
  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on its own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new approach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of theories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy with von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for informativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and removes the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have zero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each other are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an example.

Abstract: We argue that existing definitions of interpretability are not actionable in that they fail to inform users about general, sound, and robust interpretable model design. This makes current interpretability research fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose a definition of interpretability that is general, simple, and subsumes existing informal notions within the interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions, principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.

Abstract: Code retrieval aims to provide users with desired code snippets based on users' natural language queries. With the development of deep learning technologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream. Considering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a dual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into representation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the dual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the interaction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the model during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving its efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model Distillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts the dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder to improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel model distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of the dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a teaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can adaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different pre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of dual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely dual-encoder-based models for code retrieval. Besides, our model distillation technique retains over 98% of the overall performance while reducing the inference time of the dual-encoder by 70%.

Abstract: Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these models to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models. Our analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial effectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the limitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future defense development. Our code is available at https://github.com/yunsaijc/AGILE.

<title>SynAdapt: Learning Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models via Synthetic Continuous Chain-of-Thought</title>

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT). Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically, \textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this, \textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Abstract: We establish a correspondence between (fragments of) $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, a temporal extension of the $\mathcal{EL}$ description logic with the LTL operator $\bigcirc^k$, and some specific kinds of formal grammars, in particular, conjunctive grammars (context-free grammars equipped with the operation of intersection). This connection implies that $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$ does not possess the property of ultimate periodicity of models, and further leads to undecidability of query answering in $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, closing a question left open since the introduction of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$. Moreover, it also allows to establish decidability of query answering for some new interesting fragments of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, and to reuse for this purpose existing tools and algorithms for conjunctive grammars.

<title>OmniUnet: A Multimodal Network for Unstructured Terrain Segmentation on Planetary Rovers Using RGB, Depth, and Thermal Imagery</title>

Abstract: Robot navigation in unstructured environments requires multimodal perception systems that can support safe navigation. Multimodality enables the integration of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T) imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673 ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.

<title>Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems</title>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.

Abstract: As intelligent systems permeate edge devices, cloud infrastructure, and embedded real-time environments, this research proposes a new OS kernel architecture for intelligent systems, transforming kernels from static resource managers to adaptive, AI-integrated platforms. Key contributions include: (1) treating Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) as AI-oriented computation units for fast sensory and cognitive processing in kernel space; (2) expanding the Linux kernel into an AI-native environment with built-in deep learning inference, floating-point acceleration, and real-time adaptive scheduling for efficient ML workloads; and (3) introducing a Neurosymbolic kernel design leveraging Category Theory and Homotopy Type Theory to unify symbolic reasoning and differentiable logic within OS internals. Together, these approaches enable operating systems to proactively anticipate and adapt to the cognitive needs of autonomous intelligent applications.

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025, 8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However, as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield significantly different results for individual questions.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However, conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure (combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$) outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also demonstrate improved precision/recall and show that the attention mechanism provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment.

Abstract: As quantum information science advances and the need for pre-college engagement grows, a critical question remains: How can young learners be prepared to participate in a field so radically different from what they have encountered before? This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly complex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging these disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical benefits justify the effort.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking. Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets, TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is available.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video, VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo, D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs. Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag) as a method to generically represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.
  Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.

<title>Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement for Noisy Label Domain Adaptation Learning</title>

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Virtual Reality (VR) games marks a paradigm shift in the design of immersive, adaptive, and intelligent digital experiences. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent research at the intersection of LLMs and VR, examining how these models are transforming narrative generation, non-player character (NPC) interactions, accessibility, personalization, and game mastering. Drawing from an analysis of 62 peer reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, we identify key application domains ranging from emotionally intelligent NPCs and procedurally generated storytelling to AI-driven adaptive systems and inclusive gameplay interfaces. We also address the major challenges facing this convergence, including real-time performance constraints, memory limitations, ethical risks, and scalability barriers. Our findings highlight that while LLMs significantly enhance realism, creativity, and user engagement in VR environments, their effective deployment requires robust design strategies that integrate multimodal interaction, hybrid AI architectures, and ethical safeguards. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions in multimodal AI, affective computing, reinforcement learning, and open-source development, aiming to guide the responsible advancement of intelligent and inclusive VR systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear whether they can reason about the information present within their training data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Abstract: Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algorithms on search and recommender systems. It enables online platforms to create user-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective manner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal inference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B test), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine and public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to effective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for conversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant purchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker and more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for selecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online assessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our approach not only increased the sensitivity of experiments by a factor of up to 100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing but also streamlined the experimental process. The practical insights gained from usage in production can also benefit organizations with similar interests.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks and deep ensemble methods have been proposed for uncertainty quantification; however, they are computationally intensive and require large storage. By utilizing a single deterministic model, we can solve the above issue. We propose an effective method based on feature space density to quantify uncertainty for distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distributional shift has occurred. Experiments were conducted on a 2D synthetic dataset (Two Moons and Three Spirals) as well as an OOD detection task (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN). The results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

<title>MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations</title>

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing in-context learning approaches.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at: https://github.com/cosbidev/Sample-Aware_TTA.

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs' pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future inclusive AI research.

Abstract: Identifying vanilla Bayesian network to model spatial-temporal causality can be a critical yet challenging task. Different Markovian-equivalent directed acyclic graphs would be identified if the identifiability is not satisfied. To address this issue, Directed Cyclic Graph is proposed to drop the directed acyclic constraint. But it does not always hold, and cannot model dynamical time-series process. Then, Full Time Graph is proposed with introducing high-order time delay. Full Time Graph has no Markov equivalence class by assuming no instantaneous effects. But, it also assumes that the causality is invariant with varying time, that is not always satisfied in the spatio-temporal scenarios. Thus, in this work, a Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network (STBN) is proposed to theoretically model the spatial-temporal causality from the perspective of information transfer. STBN explains the disappearance of network structure $X\rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and $X\leftarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ by the principle of information path blocking. And finally, the uniqueness of STBN is proved. Based on this, a High-order Causal Entropy (HCE) algorithm is also proposed to uniquely identify STBN under time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3\tau_{max})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum time delay. Numerical experiments are conducted with comparison to other baseline algorithms. The results show that HCE algorithm obtains state-of-the-art identification accuracy.

Abstract: Federated learning benefits from cross-training strategies, which enables models to train on data from distinct sources to improve generalization capability. However, due to inherent differences in data distributions, the optimization goals of local models remain misaligned, and this mismatch continues to manifest as feature space heterogeneity even after cross-training. We argue that knowledge distillation from the personalized view preserves client-specific characteristics and expands the local knowledge base, while distillation from the global view provides consistent semantic anchors that facilitate feature alignment across clients. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a cross-training scheme, termed FedCT, includes three main modules, where the consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting module aims to optimize model assignment strategies, which enhances collaborative advantages between clients and achieves an efficient federated learning process. The multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning module leverages fused prototypical knowledge from both global and local views to enhance the preservation of local knowledge before and after model exchange, as well as to ensure consistency between local and global knowledge. The mixup-based feature augmentation module aggregates rich information to further increase the diversity of feature spaces, which enables the model to better discriminate complex samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results demonstrated that FedCT alleviates knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which enables it outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for training AI agents to coordinate with human partners. However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i) A novel dual intrinsic rewarding scheme to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii) A new context-aware weighting mechanism for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20%, and improve the sample efficiency by around 38% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the output of image classifiers use different definitions of explanations and a variety of techniques to extract them. However, none of the existing tools use a principled approach based on formal definitions of causes and explanations for the explanation extraction.
  In this paper we present a novel black-box approach to computing explanations grounded in the theory of actual causality. We prove relevant theoretical results and present an algorithm for computing approximate explanations based on these definitions. We prove termination of our algorithm and discuss its complexity and the amount of approximation compared to the precise definition.
  We implemented the framework in a tool ReX and we present experimental results and a comparison with state-of-the-art tools. We demonstrate that \rex is the most efficient tool and produces the smallest explanations, in addition to outperforming other black-box tools on standard quality measures.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), applying large language models (LLMs) to mathematical problem-solving has attracted increasing attention. Most existing approaches attempt to improve Operations Research (OR) optimization problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent framework built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The framework decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, an OR dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that in the benchmarks NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR, reasoning LLMs sometimes underperform their non-reasoning counterparts within the same model family. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that OR-LLM-Agent utilizing DeepSeek-R1 in its framework outperforms advanced methods, including GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek-R1, and ORLM, by at least 7\% in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task decomposition for OR problem solving.

Abstract: Large language model pipelines have improved automated fact-checking for complex claims, yet many approaches rely on few-shot in-context learning with demonstrations that require substantial human effort and domain expertise. Among these, program-guided reasoning, by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs, which has shown particular promise, but remains limited by the need for manually crafted demonstrations. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce BOOST, a bootstrapping approach for automated few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST iteratively refines explicit, data-driven guidelines as meta-rules for guiding demonstration creation, using a critique-refine loop that eliminates the need for human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.

Abstract: Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic algorithmic systems.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network. Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network, which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26% improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs' broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for neurosymbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

<title>On Gradual Semantics for Assumption-Based Argumentation</title>

Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract, bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as, to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of (potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess convergence.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback. Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts, semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to 1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4% improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a 4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment (CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, the generated outputs were consistently rated highly, demonstrating strong creative quality and expressive clarity. Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned creative AI.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving machine learning approach where private data remains local, enabling secure computations and the exchange of local model gradients between local clients and third-party parameter servers. However, recent findings reveal that privacy may be compromised and sensitive information potentially recovered from shared gradients. In this study, we offer detailed analysis and a novel perspective on understanding the gradient leakage problem. These theoretical works lead to a new gradient leakage defense technique that secures arbitrary model architectures using a private key-lock module. Only the locked gradient is transmitted to the parameter server for global model aggregation. Our proposed learning method is resistant to gradient leakage attacks, and the key-lock module is designed and trained to ensure that, without the private information of the key-lock module: a) reconstructing private training data from the shared gradient is infeasible; and b) the global model's inference performance is significantly compromised. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of why gradients can leak private information and provide theoretical proof of our method's effectiveness. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations with many models on several popular benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach in both maintaining model performance and defending against gradient leakage attacks.

<title>Tackling Size Generalization of Graph Neural Networks on Biological Data from a Spectral Perspective</title>

Abstract: We address the key challenge of size-induced distribution shifts in graph neural networks (GNNs) and their impact on the generalization of GNNs to larger graphs. Existing literature operates under diverse assumptions about distribution shifts, resulting in varying conclusions about the generalizability of GNNs. In contrast to prior work, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify and characterize the types of size-induced distribution shifts and explore their impact on GNN performance from a spectral standpoint, a perspective that has been largely underexplored. Leveraging the significant variance in graph sizes in real biological datasets, we analyze biological graphs and find that spectral differences, driven by subgraph patterns (e.g., average cycle length), strongly correlate with GNN performance on larger, unseen graphs. Based on these insights, we propose three model-agnostic strategies to enhance GNNs' awareness of critical subgraph patterns, identifying size-intensive attention as the most effective approach. Extensive experiments with six GNN architectures and seven model-agnostic strategies across five datasets show that our size-intensive attention strategy significantly improves graph classification on test graphs 2 to 10 times larger than the training graphs, boosting F1 scores by up to 8% over strong baselines.

Abstract: Deep learning involves navigating a high-dimensional loss landscape over the neural network parameter space. Over the course of training, complex computational structures form and re-form inside the neural network, leading to shifts in input/output behavior. It is a priority for the science of deep learning to uncover principles governing the development of neural network structure and behavior. Drawing on the framework of singular learning theory, we propose that model development is deeply linked to degeneracy in the local geometry of the loss landscape. We investigate this link by monitoring loss landscape degeneracy throughout training, as quantified by the local learning coefficient, for a transformer language model and an in-context linear regression transformer. We show that training can be divided into distinct periods of change in loss landscape degeneracy, and that these changes in degeneracy coincide with significant changes in the internal computational structure and the input/output behavior of the transformers. This finding provides suggestive evidence that degeneracy and development are linked in transformers, underscoring the potential of a degeneracy-based perspective for understanding modern deep learning.

Abstract: We introduce AttnMod, a training-free technique that modulates cross-attention in pre-trained diffusion models to generate novel, unpromptable art styles. The method is inspired by how a human artist might reinterpret a generated image, for example by emphasizing certain features, dispersing color, twisting silhouettes, or materializing unseen elements. AttnMod simulates this intent by altering how the text prompt conditions the image through attention during denoising. These targeted modulations enable diverse stylistic transformations without changing the prompt or retraining the model, and they expand the expressive capacity of text-to-image generation.

Abstract: AI policy sets boundaries on acceptable behavior for AI models, but this is challenging in the context of large language models (LLMs): how do you ensure coverage over a vast behavior space? We introduce policy maps, an approach to AI policy design inspired by the practice of physical mapmaking. Instead of aiming for full coverage, policy maps aid effective navigation through intentional design choices about which aspects to capture and which to abstract away. With Policy Projector, an interactive tool for designing LLM policy maps, an AI practitioner can survey the landscape of model input-output pairs, define custom regions (e.g., "violence"), and navigate these regions with if-then policy rules that can act on LLM outputs (e.g., if output contains "violence" and "graphic details," then rewrite without "graphic details"). Policy Projector supports interactive policy authoring using LLM classification and steering and a map visualization reflecting the AI practitioner's work. In an evaluation with 12 AI safety experts, our system helps policy designers craft policies around problematic model behaviors such as incorrect gender assumptions and handling of immediate physical safety threats.

Abstract: Cooperative mission planning for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots presents a unique set of challenges, particularly when operating under communication constraints and limited computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to coordinate distributed decision making among agents with diverse sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities, operating under sporadic ad hoc communication. A Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CMacDec-POMDP) is also formulated to effectively model asynchronous decision-making for heterogeneous teams of agents. The framework utilizes an asynchronous centralized training and distributed execution scheme, enabled by the proposed Asynchronous Multi-Agent Transformer (AMAT) architecture. This design allows a single trained model to generalize to larger environments and accommodate varying team sizes and compositions. We evaluate CATMiP in a 2D grid-world simulation environment and compare its performance against planning-based exploration methods. Results demonstrate CATMiP's superior efficiency, scalability, and robustness to communication dropouts and input noise, highlighting its potential for real-world heterogeneous mobile robot systems. The code is available at https://github.com/mylad13/CATMiP

Abstract: Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, is an effective way of improving software quality, but requires significant effort and expertise. Machine learning can automatically synthesize proofs, but such tools are able to prove only a fraction of desired software properties. We introduce Cobblestone, a divide-and-conquer approach for proof synthesis. Cobblestone uses a large language model (LLM) to generate potential proofs, uses those proofs to break the problem into simpler parts, automatically identifies which of those parts were successfully proven, and iterates on the remaining parts to build a correct proof that is guaranteed to be sound, despite the reliance on unsound LLMs. We evaluate Cobblestone on four benchmarks of open-source Coq projects, controlling for training data leakage. Fully automatically, Cobblestone outperforms state-of-the-art non-LLM tools, and proves many theorems that other LLM-based tools cannot, and on many benchmarks, outperforms them. Each Cobblestone run costs only $1.25 and takes 14.7 minutes, on average. Cobblestone can also be used with external input, from a user or another tool, providing a proof structure or relevant lemmas. Evaluated with such an oracle, Cobblestone proves up to 58% of theorems. Overall, our research shows that tools can make use of partial progress and external input to more effectively automate formal verification.

Abstract: Recently in robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling robots to execute complex tasks by integrating visual and linguistic inputs within an end-to-end learning framework. Despite their significant capabilities, VLA models introduce new attack surfaces. This paper systematically evaluates their robustness. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.

Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.

Abstract: Deploying deep models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to significant performance drops under distribution shifts between training and deployment environments. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts. Extensive experiments across various environments (corrupted, natural, and medical) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) combined with AI offers new opportunities for proactive diabetes management through real-time glucose forecasting. However, most existing models are task-specific and lack generalization across patient populations. Inspired by the autoregressive paradigm of large language models, we introduce CGM-LSM, a Transformer decoder-based Large Sensor Model (LSM) pretrained on 1.6 million CGM records from patients with different diabetes types, ages, and genders. We model patients as sequences of glucose time steps to learn latent knowledge embedded in CGM data and apply it to the prediction of glucose readings for a 2-hour horizon. Compared with prior methods, CGM-LSM significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness: a 48.51% reduction in root mean square error in one-hour horizon forecasting and consistent zero-shot prediction performance across held-out patient groups. We analyze model performance variations across patient subgroups and prediction scenarios and outline key opportunities and challenges for advancing CGM foundation models.

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting aims to predict future traffic flows based on the historical traffic conditions and the road network. It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.

<title>An Investigation into Value Misalignment in LLM-Generated Texts for Cultural Heritage</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in tasks related to cultural heritage, such as generating descriptions of historical monuments, translating ancient texts, preserving oral traditions, and creating educational content, their ability to produce accurate and culturally aligned texts is being increasingly relied upon by users and researchers. However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts. Using both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze the cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are concerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment with key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a valuable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural sensitivity and reliability of LLMs.

<title>Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs learn word representations that exhibit the undesirable yet poorly understood feature of anisotropy. In this paper, we argue that the second moment in Adam is a cause of anisotropic embeddings, and suggest a modified optimizer called Coupled Adam to mitigate the problem. Our experiments demonstrate that Coupled Adam significantly improves the quality of embeddings, while also leading to better upstream and downstream performance on large enough datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as highly capable systems and are increasingly being integrated into various uses. However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed natural language processing, making them indispensable across domains ranging from conversational systems to scientific exploration. However, their pre-trained architectures often reveal limitations in specialized contexts, including restricted reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and suboptimal domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced post-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as OpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs, systematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning, which enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures ethical coherence and alignment with human preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite challenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization amidst increasing complexity; Integration and Adaptation, which extend capabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues. Charting progress from ChatGPT's alignment strategies to DeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs leverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and enhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis of PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets, and a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning proficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its scope, this work consolidates recent PoLM advancements and establishes a rigorous intellectual framework for future research, fostering the development of LLMs that excel in precision, ethical robustness, and versatility across scientific and societal applications.

<title>ULTHO: Ultra-Lightweight yet Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a billion-dollar problem in machine learning, which significantly impacts the training efficiency and model performance. However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and computational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to adapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian optimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and computationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ULTHO, an ultra-lightweight yet powerful framework for fast HPO in deep RL within single runs. Specifically, we formulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC) and link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a quantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test ULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ULTHO can achieve superior performance with a simple architecture, contributing to the development of advanced and automated RL systems.

Abstract: Following the rise of large language models (LLMs), many studies have emerged in recent years focusing on exploring the adoption of LLM-based tools for software development by novice developers: computer science/software engineering students and early-career industry developers with two years or less of professional experience. These studies have sought to understand the perspectives of novice developers on using these tools, a critical aspect of the successful adoption of LLMs in software engineering. To systematically collect and summarise these studies, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) following the guidelines by Kitchenham et al. on 80 primary studies published between April 2022 and June 2025 to answer four research questions (RQs). In answering RQ1, we categorised the study motivations and methodological approaches. In RQ2, we identified the software development tasks for which novice developers use LLMs. In RQ3, we categorised the advantages, challenges, and recommendations discussed in the studies. Finally, we discuss the study limitations and future research needs suggested in the primary studies in answering RQ4. Throughout the paper, we also indicate directions for future work and implications for software engineering researchers, educators, and developers. Our research artifacts are publicly available at https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-SLR.

<title>Think Before Recommend: Unleashing the Latent Reasoning Power for Sequential Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22675</link>

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item by capturing sequential patterns from users' historical interactions, playing a crucial role in many real-world recommender systems. However, existing approaches predominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final hidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We argue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth, struggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a nuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{ReaRec}, the first inference-time computing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user representations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec autoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential recommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to decouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space. Moreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods, Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to further effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments on five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec. Remarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the performance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by approximately 30\%-50\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and promising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential recommendation.

<title>Simultaneous Motion And Noise Estimation with Event Cameras</title>

Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed in isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation, separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating effectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. Our approach advances event-data denoising theory and expands practical denoising use-cases via open-source code. Project page: https://github.com/tub-rip/ESMD

<title>FakeIDet: Exploring Patches for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection</title>

arXiv:2504.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of identity documents (IDs) has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, there are no publicly available data from real IDs for proper research in this area, and most published studies rely on proprietary internal databases that are not available for privacy reasons. In order to advance this critical challenge of real data scarcity that makes it so difficult to advance the technology of machine learning-based fake ID detection, we introduce a new patch-based methodology that trades off privacy and performance, and propose a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-aware fake ID detection: FakeIDet. In our experiments, we explore: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. State-of-the-art methods, such as vision transformers and foundation models, are considered as backbones. Our results show that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal for fake ID detection achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at the patch and the whole ID level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to the path-based methodology introduced and the new FakeIDet method based on it, another key contribution of our article is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from real and fake IDs, called FakeIDet-db, together with the experimental framework.

<title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>

arXiv:2504.09716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.

Abstract: End-to-end learning has shown great potential in autonomous parking, yet the lack of publicly available datasets limits reproducibility and benchmarking. While prior work introduced a visual-based parking model and a pipeline for data generation, training, and close-loop test, the dataset itself was not released. To bridge this gap, we create and open-source a high-quality dataset for end-to-end autonomous parking. Using the original model, we achieve an overall success rate of 85.16% with lower average position and orientation errors (0.24 meters and 0.34 degrees).

Abstract: Counterspeech is a key strategy against harmful online content, but scaling expert-driven efforts is challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a potential solution, though their use in countering conspiracy theories is under-researched. Unlike for hate speech, no datasets exist that pair conspiracy theory comments with expert-crafted counterspeech. We address this gap by evaluating the ability of GPT-4o, Llama 3, and Mistral to effectively apply counterspeech strategies derived from psychological research provided through structured prompts. Our results show that the models often generate generic, repetitive, or superficial results. Additionally, they over-acknowledge fear and frequently hallucinate facts, sources, or figures, making their prompt-based use in practical applications problematic.

<title>Credible Plan-Driven RAG Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>

arXiv:2504.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) presents significant challenges for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), particularly in decomposing complex queries into reliable reasoning paths and managing error propagation. Existing RAG methods often suffer from deviations in reasoning paths and cumulative errors in intermediate steps, reducing the fidelity of the final answer. To address these limitations, we propose PAR-RAG (Plan-then-Act-and-Review RAG), a novel framework inspired by the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, to enhance both the accuracy and factual consistency in multi-hop question answering. Specifically, PAR-RAG selects exemplars matched by the semantic complexity of the current question to guide complexity-aware top-down planning, resulting in more precise and coherent multi-step reasoning trajectories. This design mitigates reasoning drift and reduces the risk of suboptimal path convergence, a common issue in existing RAG approaches. Furthermore, a dual-verification mechanism evaluates and corrects intermediate errors, ensuring that the reasoning process remains factually grounded. Experimental results on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in both performance and reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have been widely tested on tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounding, but lack rigorous evaluation for alignment with human-centered (HC) values such as fairness, ethics, and inclusivity. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility.
  Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, resulting in unequal treatment of male and female subjects across different contexts. To address this issue, we propose a novel data generation framework that fosters exploratory thinking in LLMs. Our approach prompts models to generate story pairs featuring male and female protagonists in structurally identical, morally ambiguous scenarios, then elicits and compares their moral judgments. When inconsistencies arise, the model is guided to produce balanced, gender-neutral judgments. These story-judgment pairs are used to fine-tune or optimize the models via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces gender bias while preserving or even enhancing general model capabilities. We will release the code and generated data. We release the code and generated data at: https://github.com/WeiKangda/LLMs-Exploratory-Bias-Mitigation/tree/main.

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics, or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e. lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing. Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple "Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

<title>Theoretically Unmasking Inference Attacks Against LDP-Protected Clients in Federated Vision Models</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers. We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist, depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.

<title>Curious Causality-Seeking Agents Learn Meta Causal World</title>

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.

<title>MR-CLIP: Efficient Metadata-Guided Learning of MRI Contrast Representations</title>

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

Abstract: This paper presents a search for underlying analytic structures among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM) using symbolic regression and genetic programming. We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable expressions obtained with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while LLMs remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have aimed to enhance models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to reliance on single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, with the aim of reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

arXiv:2507.03703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

<title>Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen Visual Unicode Representations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04886</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

arXiv:2507.10546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks (including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/kittykg/disentangling-ndnf-classification.

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

arXiv:2507.15066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning. The code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) have been fully open-sourced to support and accelerate future research in this area.

Publicly available general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) typically offer generic agriculture advisories, lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts. Our study addresses this limitation by generating multilingual (English, Hindi, Punjabi) synthetic datasets from agriculture-specific documents from India and fine-tuning LLMs for the task of question answering (QA). Evaluation on human-created datasets demonstrates significant improvements in factuality, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned LLMs compared to the baseline counterparts.

arXiv:2507.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 on accuracy and precision on diverse datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code review tool and the encouraging results.

Summary:
PatchTraj is a novel framework designed for pedestrian trajectory prediction in autonomous driving and robotics. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating time-frequency joint modeling and dynamic patch partitioning. By decomposing trajectories into raw time sequences and frequency components, PatchTraj captures both local motion details and long-range dependencies. The framework employs adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction and hierarchical feature aggregation to model hierarchical motion patterns effectively. Cross-modal attention enhances feature fusion, resulting in accurate predictions using a Transformer architecture. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that PatchTraj achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements seen on the JRDB dataset. These results highlight the framework's potential for enhancing embodied intelligence in trajectory prediction tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate, nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for scalable and reproducible AI for science.

Summary:
This study focuses on improving the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) while mitigating social biases. Three bias-mitigation strategies are benchmarked - supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, and rule-based reinforcement learning. By varying the proportion of debiasing and reasoning samples, a trade-off between reasoning accuracy and bias reduction is identified. The optimal balance is found to be a 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning, which reduces stereotype scores by 10% while maintaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy. This research provides concrete guidance for achieving fairness and capability in MLLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy, they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.

Summary: This research highlights the significant challenges faced by current AI systems in auditory tasks that humans find easy. An auditory Turing test consisting of 917 challenges across various categories revealed a failure rate exceeding 93% for state-of-the-art audio models. These models, including GPT-4 and OpenAI's Whisper, were found to achieve only 6.9% accuracy on these tasks, far below the 52% success rate of humans. The study identified failures in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual adaptation in AI systems when processing complex auditory scenes.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917 challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise, temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes, particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models. This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

<div> Keywords: judgmental forecasting, argumentative coherence, human forecasters, Large Language Model, forecasting accuracy

Summary: 
The paper introduces the concept of argumentative coherence in judgmental forecasting, where human opinions are used to predict future events. The property of coherence requires that a forecaster's reasoning aligns with their forecast. The study evaluates the impact of enforcing coherence on human forecasters and Large Language Model (LLM)-based forecasters, showing that filtering out incoherent predictions enhances forecasting accuracy. User experiments indicate that users do not naturally align with the coherence property, highlighting the need for mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions in group forecasting predictions. The research emphasizes the practical value of coherence in improving forecasting accuracy for both human and LLM-based approaches. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model (LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before obtaining group forecasting predictions.

<div> Shapley-value-based responsibility measures, Ontology-mediated query answering, Complexity analysis, Tractability, Query optimization

Summary: 
- The paper examines the complexity of computing responsibility scores using Shapley-value-based measures in ontology-mediated query answering. 
- It shows that these measures have polynomial data complexity for certain classes of queries but become "shP"-hard for more complex query types. 
- The study explores the combined complexity of computing these scores and finds that intractability arises for atomic queries with conjunction support. 
- However, for DL-Lite dialects, there are classes of queries that allow tractable computation of responsibility scores. 
- By analyzing different query structures, the paper identifies constraints that enable tractability in computing responsibility scores. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R. A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit tractable WSMS computation.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach for handling complex instances by using a divide-and-conquer strategy that involves many small partial MILP calls instead of few complex BaB calls. A novel solution-aware ReLU scoring (SAS) method is proposed to select important ReLU variables efficiently, reducing the number of binary variables significantly while maintaining accuracy. Global ReLU scoring functions BaB-SR and BaB-FSB are adapted to improve variable selection. Implementation in Hybrid MILP, combining alpha, beta-CROWN with partial MILP, achieves high accuracy and efficiency in verification tasks for large CNNs with 2 million parameters. The approach reduces the number of undecided instances by up to 40% and keeps runtime reasonable at 46s-417s per instance, leading to low levels of undecided instances (8-15%). <div>
arXiv:2507.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and {\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP, produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Summary:
Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significant benefits but also comes with various risks. This work identifies three levels of autonomous AI and argues against fully autonomous AI due to the potential dangers, particularly with the looming threat of artificial superintelligence (ASI). The authors emphasize the necessity of responsible human oversight to mitigate these risks. Through discussions on autonomy, AI, and agents, along with presenting arguments, counterarguments, and evidence of AI misaligned values in the appendix, the paper advocates for the importance of human supervision in the development and deployment of AI technologies to ensure alignment with human values and prevent potential harm. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks, especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent. Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies, highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform. Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail, we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25 dataset.

Summary:
The article introduces a new method called Self-Foveate for instruction synthesis using large language models (LLMs). Conventional methods for training LLMs with instruction following capabilities rely heavily on human annotation, limiting diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. Self-Foveate addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-level foveation methodology to guide LLMs in extracting fine-grained information from unsupervised text, enhancing both diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. The approach was tested across various unsupervised corpora and model architectures, proving its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a "Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes: https://github.com/Mubuky/Self-Foveate

Summary:
In this study, the researchers explore the effectiveness of using advanced reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R, for causal discovery tasks. They find that these reasoning-first architectures outperform conventional models on the Corr2Cause benchmark. To enhance the performance of these models, the researchers introduce a modular in-context pipeline inspired by methodologies like Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts. This pipeline leads to significant improvements over conventional baselines. The researchers also investigate the impact of factors such as reasoning chain length and complexity on the models' performance. They conclude that while advanced reasoning models show promise for causal discovery, structuring them within in-context frameworks is crucial for maximizing their capabilities. This study offers valuable insights and a blueprint for leveraging reasoning models for causal discovery across various domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models. Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches. To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Summary: 
Existing algorithms for explaining image classifier outputs lack formal rigor, while logic-based explanations are formally defined but rely on strict model assumptions. This paper introduces causal explanations, which are formally rigorous and suitable for image classifiers. Causal explanations share formal properties with logic-based explanations and can be implemented as contrastive causal explanations. The definition of explanation is expanded to include confidence awareness and complete causal explanations, which maintain the original image's confidence level. Experimental results show that models exhibit varying sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness patterns. The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient, taking an average of 6s per image on a ResNet50 model without requiring knowledge of the model internals or gradients. <div>

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as monotonicity, of the model.

Summary:
The article introduces DICE, a framework for in-context learning in large language model-based agents. It addresses the challenge of selecting effective demonstrations for agentic tasks, which is crucial for maintaining stable and high-performance behavior. DICE decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components to prevent spurious dependencies that can hinder generalization. It also proposes a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance. DICE is a general and framework-agnostic solution that can be easily integrated into existing agentic frameworks without extra training costs. Extensive experiments across various domains validate the effectiveness and generality of DICE, emphasizing the importance of context-aware demonstration selection for robust and efficient large language model agents. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.23554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks. However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance. Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new autonomous trust orchestration method for collaborative systems. It proposes the concept of semantic chain-of-trust, utilizing agentic AI and hypergraphs to establish trust relationships among distributed devices. The agentic AI autonomously performs trust evaluations based on historical performance data during idle periods, improving resource utilization. Task-specific trust evaluations are conducted by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task requirements. Trust hypergraphs embedded with trust semantics enable hierarchical management of collaborators and efficient multi-hop collaboration. Results show that the method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation, addressing the challenges of complex tasks, dynamic resource availability, and trust assessment overhead in collaborative environments.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

To address this, a novel strategy-guided approach is proposed, where an agent transforms queries into cue-rich prompts through strategically designed processes. The challenges involve selecting appropriate recall strategies for different memory scenarios and generating high-quality responses from abstract strategy patterns. The Recall Router framework is introduced, utilizing a 5W Recall Map to categorize queries and define recall strategies, along with a hierarchical recall tree and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for strategy optimization. MemoCue, an agent developed through fine-tuning large language models on an instruction dataset, excels in providing memory-inspired responses. Experimental results demonstrate a 17.74% improvement in recall inspiration over existing methods, with human evaluations confirming its effectiveness in memory-recall applications. <div>

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges, we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in memory-recall applications.

Summary: 
The article presents a new approach called Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR) for personalized question recommendation in education. Previous methods have used reinforcement learning to model this task but struggled with efficient exploration to identify the best questions for each student during training. RAR incorporates collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, leading to more effective exploration within limited training episodes. Experimental results demonstrate that RAR significantly improves recommendation performance. The framework proposed in this study, RAR, can be applied to any reinforcement learning-based question recommender. The code implementation of RAR is available on GitHub for further exploration and application in educational settings. <div>

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this, we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in https://github.com/wuming29/RAR.git.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces TextQuests, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents in interactive fiction games. It aims to assess agents' intrinsic reasoning capabilities over long horizons by focusing on self-contained problem-solving within a single session. Unlike traditional benchmarks, TextQuests restricts the use of external tools, requiring agents to rely on trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving. The benchmark is based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games, which are complex and demand hundreds of precise actions to solve, mirroring real-world challenges. By challenging agents to navigate these text-based adventures that can take human players over 30 hours, TextQuests provides a unique opportunity to evaluate AI agents in exploratory environments where autonomous reasoning and decision-making are crucial. TextQuests can be accessed at https://textquests.ai. <div>

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Summary: 
Seed-Prover is a new lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model designed to solve complex mathematical problems, particularly at the IMO level. It leverages reinforcement learning and formal verification through Lean to refine its proof iteratively. The model achieves a high success rate in proving formalized past IMO problems and excels in contest benchmarks. In addition, the introduction of Seed-Geometry enhances geometry reasoning capabilities. The systems participated in IMO 2025, successfully proving a majority of the problems. This work showcases significant progress in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the efficacy of formal verification in conjunction with long chain-of-thought reasoning.<br /><br />Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2507.23726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.

Summary: 

The article introduces CoT-Self-Instruct, a method for generating synthetic data for training Language Model Models (LLMs). This method involves instructing LLMs to reason and plan using Chain-of-Thought based on seed tasks, generating high-quality synthetic prompts, and filtering the data with automatic metrics. The synthetic data produced using this method performs significantly better than existing datasets in tasks involving verifiable reasoning such as MATH500, AMC23, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond. Additionally, for non-verifiable instruction-following tasks like AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard, CoT-Self-Instruct outperforms human-generated prompts and standard self-instruct prompts. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing LLM training with high-quality synthetic data.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard.

Summary:
SimuRA is a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning that aims to create a more powerful AI agent utilizing large language models (LLMs). By overcoming the limitations of autoregressive reasoning through a world model for planning via simulation, SimuRA demonstrates improved success in challenging web browsing tasks. The implementation of a generalized world model using LLM allows for flexible planning in various environments using the rich latent space of natural language. Experiments show significant enhancements, with flight search success increasing from 0% to 32.2%. The world-model-based planning approach consistently outperforms autoregressive planning by up to 124%, highlighting the advantages of simulation as a reasoning paradigm. The prospect of training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can perform superintelligently across all environments is promising. The availability of SimuRA as a web-browsing agent with pretrained LLMs for public testing further contributes to advancing research in AI development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.

Summary:
The study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating code for visualization and understanding common visualizations. LLMs show ability in generating code for simpler visualizations like bar and pie charts and answering basic questions about visualizations. However, they struggle with complex visualizations such as violin plots and make errors in determining relationships between visuals and lengths of shapes. The findings suggest the potential for LLMs to improve Information Visualization systems but also highlight the need to address their limitations. The study provides insights into the capabilities and challenges of LLMs in the context of information visualization. <div>

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations. For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations, such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

Summary: 
Cognitive Infrastructure Studies (CIS) proposes to examine how AI systems shape human cognition pre-consciously, altering the way knowledge and action are perceived in digital societies. By reconceptualizing AI as "cognitive infrastructures", the study focuses on how these systems influence meaning, personalized experiences, and invisibly automate relevance judgment, thus shifting epistemic agency away from humans. Through narrative scenarios at individual, collective, and societal levels, CIS illustrates how these infrastructures impact cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. The framework aims to bridge gaps between cognitive science, digital sociology, and computational approaches by offering innovative methodologies such as "infrastructure breakdown methodologies" to study the invisible algorithmic influence and dependencies. This interdisciplinary domain seeks to understand and analyze the transformative effects of AI preprocessing on distributed cognition across various scales.

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment," shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: "infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both quantitively and qualitatively.

arXiv:2507.22897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS, but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores. RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse, controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Abstract: This exploratory study examines how AI code assistants shape novice programmers' experiences during a two-part exam in an introductory programming course. In the first part, students completed a programming task with access to AI support; in the second, they extended their solutions without AI. We collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to evaluate their perceptions and challenges. Findings suggest that AI tools were perceived as helpful for understanding code and increasing confidence, particularly during initial development. However, students reported difficulties transferring knowledge to unaided tasks, revealing possible overreliance and gaps in conceptual understanding. These insights highlight the need for pedagogical strategies that integrate AI meaningfully while reinforcing foundational programming skills.

Summary: 
An autonomous AI system, Doctronic, was evaluated in 500 virtual urgent care encounters. Results showed 81% diagnostic concordance and 99.2% treatment plan consistency with human clinicians. No clinical hallucinations were observed. In cases of disagreement, AI outperformed human clinicians in 36.1%, with equivalent diagnoses in the rest. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-agent AI systems to alleviate healthcare workforce shortages, with AI matching or exceeding human clinical decision-making capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2507.22902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages.

Summary: 
SketchMind is a multi-agent framework designed to evaluate and improve student-drawn scientific sketches. It consists of modular agents for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and providing iterative feedback for sketch modification. By integrating the framework with SRG, SketchMind achieves a significant increase in accuracy compared to baseline models. The multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances performance, with GPT-4.1 showing improved sketch prediction accuracy. Human evaluators rated the system's feedback and co-created sketches highly, noting its potential to support conceptual growth through guided revision. The release of code and dataset will support reproducibility and further research in AI-driven education. SketchMind provides a transparent, personalized, and interpretive approach to evaluating student scientific sketches, bridging the gap between AI assessment and pedagogical alignment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students' conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches. SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items. Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by \textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5, significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o). Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

<div> Keywords: H2AD MIMO architecture, target number sensing, deep neural network, DOA estimation, Cramér-Rao lower bound

Summary: 
The article introduces a two-stage sensing framework for the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital (H2AD) MIMO architecture to intelligently estimate the number and direction values of multiple targets. Three target number sensing methods are proposed, including an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN), and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). A low-complexity and high-accuracy direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is achieved through the online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. The Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions is derived as a performance benchmark. Simulation results demonstrate 100% accuracy in target number sensing at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), with the improved 1D-CNN showing superiority at extremely low SNRs. The OMC-DOA method outperforms existing DOA methods in multi-source environments. <div>

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

<div> Keywords: fraudulent activities, federated learning, quantum-enhanced LSTM, privacy preserving techniques, fraud detection

Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses the challenges posed by the increase in fraudulent activities in the financial sector due to the growth of digital transactions. To address this issue, a specialized federated learning framework is introduced, combining a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with advanced privacy-preserving techniques. By integrating quantum layers into the LSTM architecture, the framework can effectively capture complex cross-transactional patterns, leading to a 5% improvement in performance compared to conventional models. The framework includes "FedRansel," a novel method that safeguards against poisoning and inference attacks, reducing model degradation and improving inference accuracy by 4-8% compared to standard differential privacy mechanisms. This pseudo-centralized setup, featuring a Quantum LSTM model, not only enhances fraud detection accuracy but also enhances the security and confidentiality of sensitive financial data. <div>

Abstract: Rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a surge in fraudulent activities, challenging traditional detection methods in the financial sector. To tackle this problem, we introduce a specialised federated learning framework that uniquely combines a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with advanced privacy preserving techniques. By integrating quantum layers into the LSTM architecture, our approach adeptly captures complex cross-transactional patters, resulting in an approximate 5% performance improvement across key evaluation metrics compared to conventional models. Central to our framework is "FedRansel", a novel method designed to defend against poisoning and inference attacks, thereby reducing model degradation and inference accuracy by 4-8%, compared to standard differential privacy mechanisms. This pseudo-centralised setup with a Quantum LSTM model, enhances fraud detection accuracy and reinforces the security and confidentiality of sensitive financial data.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) were integrated into the CALEIDOHOTELS property reservation platform to improve the consistency and reliability of accommodation data sourced from third-party providers. Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B LLMs were evaluated for their ability to generate consistent descriptions with minimal hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B outperformed Mistral 7B in completeness, precision, and hallucination rate, producing more concise content at a higher computational cost. The findings highlight the trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering insights for deploying LLMs in production environments. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in enhancing the quality of accommodation data on online booking platforms.

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B, fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt. Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision (98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

<div> Keywords: Electric power marketing, Customer service, Large language models, Dialogue dataset, Knowledge augmentation<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces ElectriQ, a benchmark created to evaluate and enhance large language models in the field of electric power marketing customer service. Current systems like China's 95598 hotline face challenges such as slow response times and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language models like GPT-4o have strong general capabilities, they lack domain expertise and empathy required in this field. ElectriQ includes a dialogue dataset covering key service categories and introduces evaluation metrics such as professionalism, popularity, readability, and user-friendliness. By incorporating a domain-specific knowledge base and proposing a knowledge augmentation method, smaller models like LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and augmented, can outperform larger models like GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a foundation for developing language models tailored to the specific needs of electric power marketing services. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities, they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

<div> Keyword: illegal marketplace, deep and dark web, language models, ensemble learning, illicit content detection

Summary:
This research paper addresses the challenge of detecting and categorizing illicit marketplace content on various online platforms, including the deep and dark web, Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. The authors propose a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy. By using a transformer model called ModernBERT, specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns specific to illicit language are captured. Manual features such as document structure and embedded patterns are also incorporated to complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline consists of two stages: the first stage detects sales-related documents using an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM, while the second stage further classifies these documents into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several baselines, achieving high accuracy, F1-score, and TMCC, showcasing strong generalization and effectiveness in detecting illicit content. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for subject analysis in library management systems. Traditional machine learning (ML) models have limitations in handling unseen cases, while LLMs tend to over-generate and hallucinate. To address these issues, the researchers propose a hybrid framework that combines embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach involves using ML models to predict the optimal number of subject labels and post-editing the LLM-generated terms with actual Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that providing initial predictions to guide LLM outputs and implementing post-edits leads to more controlled and aligned subject terms. The hybrid framework shows promise in enhancing subject access to information resources in libraries.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1) predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2) post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and vocabulary-aligned outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models. We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of hallucination in LLMs.

Summary: 
This study investigates a novel neuron model based on symmetric differential equations, highlighting its dual functionality as a signal propagator and signal generator. Through mathematical analysis, the model's core property of functional duality is revealed, with two distinct trajectory behaviors: one stable for signal propagation and the other stable for self-excited oscillations. The introduction of an intermediate-state metric, on-road energy, aids in monitoring system states during simulations. Transitions between functional modes can be induced by parameter adjustments, and oscillations can be suppressed with external signals. The model's characteristics align with the dual roles of biological neurons in information transmission and rhythm generation, paving the way for broader applications in neuromorphic engineering. <div>

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic engineering.

The methodology involves disentangling queries into core subjects and temporal windows, utilizing a specialized retriever to gather temporally coherent evidence. The Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB) is introduced for rigorous evaluation, focusing on a hybrid corpus of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB demonstrate significant improvements in answer accuracy compared to standard RAG implementations.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static, factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional, semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required for complex, real-world questions.

Summary: 
The study evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information solely from trial registrations. Two models were developed: a classifier predicting which trial arm would have higher SAE rates and a regression model predicting the proportion of SAEs in control arms. By using a transfer learning approach with pretrained language models and a sliding window method for embedding extraction, the best model achieved a 77.6% AUC in predicting SAE rates and an RMSE of 18.6% in predicting the proportion of SAEs in control arms. Utilizing data from ClinicalTrials.gov, the study highlighted the potential to estimate trial results before they commence, aiding in trial design improvement and identifying discrepancies between expected and reported safety outcomes. <div>

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107 two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across 12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion: Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported safety results.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

<div> Keywords: Language models, Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm, Knowledge extraction, Medical documents, Prediction speed

Summary:
The Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm addresses the issues of costly and inaccurate information production by language models. It ensures that a language model's response to a given prompt is correct by validating it against a collection of possible answers. This process involves feeding incorrect responses into more predictive models until all predictions are accurate. The LMC algorithm was successfully used to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents, demonstrating improved prediction speed and accuracy while reducing hallucinations. The approach of combining multiple language models in a multi-stage cascade proved to be highly effective. The novel LMC algorithm has great potential in the knowledge extraction field and should be further explored for its benefits in producing accurate and efficient information. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e., candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored much further in the future.

Summary: The study examines whether sentiment from social media, specifically Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, can predict stock market movements, focusing on GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Three sentiment analysis methods are applied, indicating a weak correlation between social media sentiment and stock prices. Simpler metrics like comment volume and Google search trends show stronger predictive signals. This suggests that traditional sentiment analysis may not fully capture retail investor behavior nuances within market-moving online discussions. <div>

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends, exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Summary:
This paper explores the impact of different prompt translation strategies in multilingual classification tasks using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs). The study focuses on optimizing prompting strategies to improve knowledge sharing across languages and enhance performance on classification tasks. Two common practices, pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and cross-lingual prompting for direct inference, are evaluated. The experimental results indicate that an optimized prompting strategy can significantly enhance knowledge sharing and improve performance in multilingual systems. This emphasizes the importance of leveraging multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization, especially for low-resource languages. The findings suggest that with the right prompting strategy, multilingual LLMs can effectively bridge language barriers and enhance the capabilities of multilingual systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems, knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios, two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages, especially the low-resource ones.

Summary: 
The study delves into the resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs) when subjected to structural interventions such as deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, the models showcase a preservation of 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without requiring any fine-tuning. It is observed that performance degradation varies across layers, with early and final layers being most affected while middle layers exhibit remarkable robustness. The research identifies four distinct stages of inference common across different model sizes and families. These stages include detokenization, feature engineering, prediction ensembling, and residual sharpening. By integrating behavioral and mechanistic evidence, the study offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the depth-dependent computations in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions by deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.

Summary: This study introduces a Bayesian approach utilizing Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. The method incorporates a prior distribution that allows for the generation of numerous synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, enabling the meta-learning of extrapolation. Compared to existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches, the proposed PFN demonstrates superior performance, especially in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning. By quantifying uncertainty, the PFN offers reliable extrapolation results, essential for decision-making applications involving resource investment. <div>

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

<div> Keywords: large language models, chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning, instruction following, complex instructions

Summary:
Existing large language models struggle with following complex instructions due to challenges in understanding multiple constraints organized in different structures. The chain-of-thought approach, while intuitive, falls short as it only paraphrases instructions without deeply understanding their relationships. A proposed method uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to enhance reasoning for instruction following. By decomposing complex instructions, applying rule-centric rewards, and leveraging behavior cloning, the method improves LLM performance significantly. In evaluations across seven benchmarks, a 1.5B LLM achieved an 11.74% increase in performance with results comparable to an 8B LLM. This approach shows promise in enhancing LLM capabilities for handling complex instructions effectively.

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).

<div> Keywords: surgeon-specific behavior prediction, robotic surgery, gesture prediction, privacy implications, personalized embeddings 

Summary: 
Surgeons possess individual operating styles influenced by their training and experience, yet current surgical AI systems often overlook this personalized signal. This study introduces a new agentic modeling approach for predicting surgeon-specific behavior in robotic surgery. By combining a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action pipeline, the model can accurately forecast gesture sequences based on multimodal inputs like surgical video and intent language. Moreover, personalized embeddings of surgeon identity and skill are incorporated using natural language prompts from third-party models, allowing the model to capture unique behavioral styles without revealing explicit identity. Evaluation on the JIGSAWS dataset shows that the model effectively reconstructs gestures while learning distinct motion fingerprints for each surgeon. However, the study also highlights the trade-off between performance and privacy, as more expressive embeddings enhance task accuracy but also increase the risk of identity leakage. This underscores the need to strike a balance between personalization and privacy protection in surgical modeling. <div>

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles shaped by training, experience, and motor behavior-yet most surgical AI systems overlook this personalization signal. We propose a novel agentic modeling approach for surgeon-specific behavior prediction in robotic surgery, combining a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Gesture prediction is framed as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including surgical video, intent language, and personalized embeddings of surgeon identity and skill. These embeddings are encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

<div> Keywords: Symbolic regression, neural network, interpretability, oversampling, pruning

Summary: 
The study introduces the LIES framework, a neural network architecture designed for symbolic regression. LIES incorporates interpretable primitive activations such as Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, and Sine functions to optimize the modeling of symbolic expressions. A novel training approach involving oversampling and a specialized loss function is employed to encourage sparsity and prevent gradient instability. Post-training, additional pruning strategies are applied to simplify the learned expressions further into compact formulae. Experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks demonstrate that the LIES framework consistently generates sparse and accurate symbolic formulae, outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies validate the significance of each component of the framework in achieving these results. The LIES framework presents a promising approach to symbolic regression, offering improved interpretability and analytical insight compared to conventional black-box models.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.

Summary: 
This article introduces a taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and proposes desired model behavior for each type. The authors present CONFLICTS, a benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in RAG settings, to assess how models address knowledge conflicts. Experimental results show that large language models struggle to resolve conflicts between retrieved sources. Prompting models to explicitly reason about conflicts improves response quality. However, there is still significant room for improvement in this area. The CONFLICTS benchmark provides a valuable tool for tracking progress in addressing knowledge conflicts and highlights the need for further research in enhancing model performance in handling conflicting information. <br> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

<div> attention-based method, binary attention masks, object perception, out-of-distribution backgrounds, two-stage framework

Summary: 
The article introduces an attention-based method utilizing learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence predictions. Contextual factors can impact object perception, leading to biased representations, especially in out-of-distribution backgrounds. The proposed two-stage framework addresses this challenge by first processing the full image to identify object parts and task-relevant regions. The second stage uses input attention masking to focus its analysis on these regions, filtering out potentially irrelevant information. Both stages are jointly trained, allowing the second stage to refine the first. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that this approach enhances robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds. The code for the method is available on GitHub for reference.

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.

Summary:  
EdgeProfiler introduces a fast profiling framework for evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. The framework profiles compact LLMs using aggressive quantization techniques and strict memory constraints to address challenges in resource-constrained edge settings. Analytical modeling estimates latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption, with findings showing that 4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by 60-70% while maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines on various edge devices, and power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for INT4 configurations. This enables practical deployment on hardware like Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super, highlighting the importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge environments for balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational feasibility.

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that 4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

Summary:  
Reward models are essential for improving large language models, especially in reinforcement learning and inference-time verification. Current reward modeling faces challenges in identifying specific components within response trajectories that correlate with overall scores, leading to poor generalization on new responses. To address this, a new approach using generation probabilities to establish reward consistency across processes in response trajectories is proposed. By enforcing intra-trajectory consistency regularization, adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probabilities maintain more consistent rewards. This improves the performance of the outcome reward model on RewardBench and induces better policies aligned with DPO. The model trained with this regularization also achieves improved best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results. The code for implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

Summary:
The study explores latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, comparing it with standard multi-head attention (MHA) and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). The research demonstrates that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions achieves a significant memory reduction without sacrificing validation loss. Rotary positional embeddings play a crucial role in improving MLA performance in small models. MLA with reduced rank dimensions shows a speedup in inference on NVIDIA A100 GPUs while maintaining memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations indicate that the proposed approach achieves the highest quality scores in grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. The study presents a Pareto improvement for memory-constrained deployment, showcasing the potential of MLA in enhancing the efficiency and quality of small language models. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Summary:
Location Preference Optimization (LPO) is introduced as a novel approach for improving interaction precision in Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by leveraging locational data. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on information-rich zones and introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance. This approach, coupled with Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), enhances interaction precision and allows for extensive exploration of GUI environments. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of LPO, achieving state-of-the-art results in both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Summary: EmoNet-Voice introduces a new resource for speech emotion detection, providing a large-scale pre-training dataset (EmoNet-Voice Big) and a benchmark dataset (EmoNet-Voice Bench). The datasets feature a wide range of emotions and intensity levels. Synthetic audio snippets were created to simulate actors portraying emotions, validated by psychology experts. The approach allows for inclusion of sensitive emotional states not present in existing datasets. The Empathic Insight Voice models achieved high agreement with human experts. Evaluation of SER models revealed that detecting high-arousal emotions like anger is easier than low-arousal states like concentration.

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions, and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect than low-arousal states like concentration.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, interpretability, agentic interpretability, mental model, human understanding

Summary: 
The article discusses a new form of interpretability called agentic interpretability, which involves a multi-turn conversation between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in understanding. This approach goes beyond traditional methods of opening the black-box to actively develop a mental model of the user and improve human understanding of the LLM. While agentic interpretability may lack completeness in high-stakes safety situations, it aims to help humans grasp potentially superhuman concepts of LLMs. Challenges in evaluation arise from the human-entangled-in-the-loop nature of the process, requiring innovative solutions. As LLMs approach human parity in various tasks, agentic interpretability offers a way for humans to enhance their understanding of these complex models rather than become increasingly disconnected from them.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for interpretability--agentic interpretability: a multi-turn conversation with an LLM wherein the LLM proactively assists human understanding by developing and leveraging a mental model of the user, which in turn enables humans to develop better mental models of the LLM. Such conversation is a new capability that traditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do not use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just knowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well, understanding that their success will be measured by the student's comprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for interactivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with potentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover potentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of machines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in evaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans responses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation difficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach human parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help humans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see us fall increasingly far from understanding them.

<div> Keywords: vaccines, immunotherapeutics, artificial intelligence, deep learning, predictive frameworks

Summary: 
Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) are revolutionizing the design of vaccines and immunotherapeutics by providing predictive frameworks for rapid decision-making and efficient data-driven strategies. They integrate computational models, systems vaccinology, and multi-omics data to predict immune responses, identify optimal targets, and understand immune regulation. These technologies aim to replace animal testing with computational models, as suggested by the US FDA, and enable real-time in vivo modeling for clinical trials. The future of AI and DL holds promise for the development of personalized vaccines and immunotherapeutics against infectious pathogens and cancers. <div>
arXiv:2506.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics relied heavily on trial-and-error experimentation and extensive in vivo testing, often requiring years of pre-clinical and clinical trials. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) are actively transforming vaccine and immunotherapeutic design, by (i) offering predictive frameworks that support rapid, data-driven decision-making; (ii) increasingly being implemented as time- and resource-efficient strategies that integrate computational models, systems vaccinology, and multi-omics data to better phenotype, differentiate, and classify patient diseases and cancers; predict patients' immune responses; and identify the factors contributing to optimal vaccine and immunotherapeutic protective efficacy; (iii) refining the selection of B- and T-cell antigen/epitope targets to enhance efficacy and durability of immune protection; and (iv) enabling a deeper understanding of immune regulation, immune evasion, immune checkpoints, and regulatory pathways. The future of AI and DL points toward (i) replacing animal preclinical testing of drugs, vaccines, and immunotherapeutics with computational-based models, as recently proposed by the United States FDA; and (ii) enabling real-time in vivo modeling for immunobridging and prediction of protection in clinical trials. This may result in a fast and transformative shift for the development of personal vaccines and immunotherapeutics against infectious pathogens and cancers.

<div> machine learning, hardware verification, RTL code generation, testbenches, LLM

Summary:
PRO-V is a new multi-agent system designed for robust RTL verification in hardware design. It utilizes machine learning models to generate testbenches with high accuracy, particularly focusing on RTL code generation. PRO-V incorporates an iterative sampling strategy to improve testbench correctness and introduces an LLM-as-a-judge validation framework for error detection. This framework converts compiler static analysis into natural language through in-context learning, allowing LLMs to assist in identifying errors in RTL design or testbenches. The system achieves a verification accuracy of 87.17% on golden RTL implementations and 76.28% on RTL mutants. The code for PRO-V is open-sourced, providing a valuable resource for hardware verification and design. <div>
arXiv:2506.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-assisted hardware verification is gaining substantial attention due to its potential to significantly reduce the cost and effort of crafting effective testbenches. It also serves as a critical enabler for LLM-aided end-to-end hardware language design. However, existing current LLMs often struggle with Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, resulting in testbenches that exhibit functional errors in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) logic. Motivated by the strong performance of LLMs in Python code generation under inference-time sampling strategies, and their promising capabilities as judge agents, we propose PRO-V a fully program generation multi-agent system for robust RTL verification. Pro-V incorporates an efficient best-of-n iterative sampling strategy to enhance the correctness of generated testbenches. Moreover, it introduces an LLM-as-a-judge aid validation framework featuring an automated prompt generation pipeline. By converting rule-based static analysis from the compiler into natural language through in-context learning, this pipeline enables LLMs to assist the compiler in determining whether verification failures stem from errors in the RTL design or the testbench. PRO-V attains a verification accuracy of 87.17% on golden RTL implementations and 76.28% on RTL mutants. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/stable-lab/Pro-V.

Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3\% in precision and up to 22.3\% in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.

<div> AI, humans, collaboration, automation, ethics
Summary: 
AI is becoming an integral part of our lives, transforming various aspects of society by augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them. This collaborative relationship between AI and humans is reshaping work dynamics, with AI agents autonomously handling tasks while humans supervise and guide them. This shift offers numerous benefits such as efficiency, faster decision-making, and cost savings, but also poses risks like algorithmic bias and security flaws. To successfully navigate this transition, organizations need to rethink roles, invest in upskilling, embed ethical principles, and promote transparency. The responsible adoption of AI-first systems requires a balance between autonomy and human oversight, ensuring alignment with goals, values, and context. Thus, it is crucial for organizations to adapt to these technological and organizational changes to harness the full potential of AI while upholding ethical standards. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between humans and artificial intelligence is no longer science fiction -- it's a growing reality reshaping how we live and work. AI has moved beyond research labs into everyday life, powering customer service chats, personalizing travel, aiding doctors in diagnosis, and supporting educators. What makes this moment particularly compelling is AI's increasing collaborative nature. Rather than replacing humans, AI augments our capabilities -- automating routine tasks, enhancing decisions with data, and enabling creativity in fields like design, music, and writing. The future of work is shifting toward AI agents handling tasks autonomously, with humans as supervisors, strategists, and ethical stewards. This flips the traditional model: instead of humans using AI as a tool, intelligent agents will operate independently within constraints, managing everything from scheduling and customer service to complex workflows. Humans will guide and fine-tune these agents to ensure alignment with goals, values, and context.
  This shift offers major benefits -- greater efficiency, faster decisions, cost savings, and scalability. But it also brings risks: diminished human oversight, algorithmic bias, security flaws, and a widening skills gap. To navigate this transition, organizations must rethink roles, invest in upskilling, embed ethical principles, and promote transparency. This paper examines the technological and organizational changes needed to enable responsible adoption of AI-first systems -- where autonomy is balanced with human intent, oversight, and values.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Deterministic Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs) model decision-making scenarios where outcomes are determined by the current action taken. The mean-payoff objective is a fundamental measure of cumulative reward in DMDPs. Howard's policy iteration algorithm is commonly used to solve DMDPs with mean-payoff objectives, but the current lower bound on its performance is sub-linear with respect to the input size. This study presents an improved lower bound, showing that the algorithm requires a minimum number of iterations proportional to the input size. This finding has implications for optimizing decision-making processes in DMDPs. <div>
arXiv:2506.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs) are a mathematical framework for decision-making where the outcomes and future possible actions are deterministically determined by the current action taken. DMDPs can be viewed as a finite directed weighted graph, where in each step, the controller chooses an outgoing edge. An objective is a measurable function on runs (or infinite trajectories) of the DMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal cumulative reward (or weight) that the controller can guarantee. We consider the classical mean-payoff (aka limit-average) objective, which is a basic and fundamental objective.
  Howard's policy iteration algorithm is a popular method for solving DMDPs with mean-payoff objectives. Although Howard's algorithm performs well in practice, as experimental studies suggested, the best known upper bound is exponential and the current known lower bound is as follows: For the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{I})$ iterations, where $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides the poly-logarithmic factors, i.e., the current lower bound on iterations is sub-linear with respect to the input size. Our main result is an improved lower bound for this fundamental algorithm where we show that for the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(I)$ iterations.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach, Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential Differential Game (DFP-PDG), to model vehicle interactions at unsignalized intersections by learning human-like driving policies. By incorporating a Differential Game formulation transformed into a Potential Differential Game, the framework learns weights from naturalistic driving datasets to capture diverse driving styles. The convergence to a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed, distinguishing this study as the first to utilize Deep Fictitious Play for training interactive driving policies. Validation using the INTERACTION dataset shows that the DFP-PDG framework effectively learns human-like policies, successfully capturing variations in driver aggressiveness and preferences. An ablation study underscores the significance of each component within the model. Overall, the proposed framework demonstrates promising results in simulating interactive driving behaviors at unsignalized intersections. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling vehicle interactions at unsignalized intersections is a challenging task due to the complexity of the underlying game-theoretic processes. Although prior studies have attempted to capture interactive driving behaviors, most approaches relied solely on game-theoretic formulations and did not leverage naturalistic driving datasets. In this study, we learn human-like interactive driving policies at unsignalized intersections using Deep Fictitious Play. Specifically, we first model vehicle interactions as a Differential Game, which is then reformulated as a Potential Differential Game. The weights in the cost function are learned from the dataset and capture diverse driving styles. We also demonstrate that our framework provides a theoretical guarantee of convergence to a Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to train interactive driving policies using Deep Fictitious Play. We validate the effectiveness of our Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential Differential Game (DFP-PDG) framework using the INTERACTION dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory performance in learning human-like driving policies. The learned individual weights effectively capture variations in driver aggressiveness and preferences. Furthermore, the ablation study highlights the importance of each component within our model.

<div> Keywords: large language models, benchmarks, software engineering, GitHub, memorization 

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted, but the evaluation of their abilities using benchmarks such as SWE-Bench Verified may overstate their true capabilities. A diagnostic task involving identifying file paths from issue descriptions alone revealed that LLMs may be achieving high accuracy through memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. State-of-the-art models achieved up to 76% accuracy on this task but significantly lower accuracy on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, suggesting possible data contamination or memorization issues. These findings highlight the need for more robust and contamination-resistant benchmarks to accurately assess LLMs' coding abilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce a diagnostic task: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

The article explores the role of ontologies in enhancing hybrid modeling and simulation by improving semantic rigor, model reusability, and interoperability across systems, disciplines, and tools. It distinguishes between methodological and referential ontologies to address interoperability challenges along Human-Human, Human-Machine, and Machine-Machine axes. Techniques like competency questions, ontology design patterns, and layered strategies are highlighted for promoting shared understanding and formal precision. Integrating ontologies with Semantic Web Technologies, they serve as descriptive domain representations and prescriptive guides for simulation construction. Four application cases demonstrate the practical benefits of ontology-driven hybrid simulation workflows in sea-level rise analysis, Industry 4.0 modeling, artificial societies for policy support, and cyber threat evaluation. Challenges and opportunities in ontology-based hybrid M&amp;S are discussed, including tool integration, semantic alignment, and support for explainable AI.

Abstract: We explore the role of ontologies in enhancing hybrid modeling and simulation through improved semantic rigor, model reusability, and interoperability across systems, disciplines, and tools. By distinguishing between methodological and referential ontologies, we demonstrate how these complementary approaches address interoperability challenges along three axes: Human-Human, Human-Machine, and Machine-Machine. Techniques such as competency questions, ontology design patterns, and layered strategies are highlighted for promoting shared understanding and formal precision. Integrating ontologies with Semantic Web Technologies, we showcase their dual role as descriptive domain representations and prescriptive guides for simulation construction. Four application cases - sea-level rise analysis, Industry 4.0 modeling, artificial societies for policy support, and cyber threat evaluation - illustrate the practical benefits of ontology-driven hybrid simulation workflows. We conclude by discussing challenges and opportunities in ontology-based hybrid M&amp;S, including tool integration, semantic alignment, and support for explainable AI.

Summary: 
The study introduces a structural framework, the Budget AI Researcher, for research idea generation that uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains and vector databases to recombine concepts from machine learning papers. The system organizes papers from major AI conferences into a hierarchical topic tree to generate novel research abstracts. Through iterative self-evaluation and refinement against relevant literature and peer reviews, it produces grounded and interesting research ideas. Experimental results show significant improvements in the concreteness of generated ideas compared to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations also indicate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. The Budget AI Researcher aims to bridge the gap between academic data and creative generation, offering a practical tool to accelerate scientific discovery and support aspiring researchers. The approach not only benefits research ideation but also inspires the generation of personalized, context-aware outputs based on evolving real-world knowledge. <div>
arXiv:2506.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating the vast and rapidly growing body of scientific literature is a formidable challenge for aspiring researchers. Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting.

Summary:  
- The article introduces Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD) as an extension of ARD for probabilistic models, aiming to model sparse relationships between inputs and outputs while capturing correlation among the outputs using a matrix normal prior.
- NARD updates precision matrix and relationships iteratively to identify and discard irrelevant features, promoting sparsity in the model.
- To enhance computational efficiency, Sequential NARD and Surrogate Function Method are introduced, reducing computational costs by evaluating features sequentially and simplifying calculations.
- The computational complexity per iteration is reduced significantly for NARD, Sequential NARD, and Surrogate Function Method, showing improved efficiency without compromising performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<div> retrieval, multimodal, reranking, reasoning, reinforcement learning

Summary:
MM-R5 is a new multimodal document retrieval system that enhances reranking through reinforcement learning and reasoning. The model is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning improves instruction-following and reasoning chain generation, while reinforcement learning refines reasoning quality with task-specific rewards. The proposed model, MM-R5, outperforms existing methods on the MMDocIR benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and significantly improving recall@1. The reasoning-enhanced training pipeline of MM-R5 proves effective in enhancing retrieval precision in multimodal document retrieval tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

<div> Keywords: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Ghost Policies, Arvolution, Augmented Reality, Failure Visualization Learning

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers have introduced the concept of "Ghost Policies" through the Arvolution framework to address the opacity and complexity of failures in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents. Arvolution uses Augmented Reality to visually render failed policy trajectories as semi-transparent "ghosts" that coexist with the active agent. This allows for a better understanding and visualization of policy divergence. The framework includes a behavioral taxonomy of DRL maladaptation, a protocol for studying failure through human disruption, and a dual-learning loop for both humans and agents to learn from failures. This approach transforms DRL agent failures from costly errors to valuable learning resources, leading to the creation of a new research field called "Failure Visualization Learning." <div>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents often exhibit intricate failure modes that are difficult to understand, debug, and learn from. This opacity hinders their reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address this critical gap, we introduce ``Ghost Policies,'' a concept materialized through Arvolution, a novel Augmented Reality (AR) framework. Arvolution renders an agent's historical failed policy trajectories as semi-transparent ``ghosts'' that coexist spatially and temporally with the active agent, enabling an intuitive visualization of policy divergence. Arvolution uniquely integrates: (1) AR visualization of ghost policies, (2) a behavioural taxonomy of DRL maladaptation, (3) a protocol for systematic human disruption to scientifically study failure, and (4) a dual-learning loop where both humans and agents learn from these visualized failures. We propose a paradigm shift, transforming DRL agent failures from opaque, costly errors into invaluable, actionable learning resources, laying the groundwork for a new research field: ``Failure Visualization Learning.''

<div> Evaluation, consistency, language models, transformations, benchmarks

Summary:
The article introduces ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework that measures consistency in large language models (LLMs) by assessing reversible transformations in tasks such as machine translation and AI-assisted programming. Nodes in the framework represent text states, while edges signify pairs of inverse operations. Dynamic benchmarks ensure fair assessment of model generalization, without using paired data. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models show that ConsistencyChecker effectively distinguishes model performance and correlates strongly with WMT 2024 auto-ranking. The implementation of ConsistencyChecker is available on GitHub for further exploration and usage. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating consistency in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliability, particularly in complex, multi-step interactions between humans and LLMs. Traditional self-consistency methods often miss subtle semantic changes in natural language and functional shifts in code or equations, which can accumulate over multiple transformations. To address this, we propose ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework designed to measure consistency through sequences of reversible transformations, including machine translation tasks and AI-assisted programming tasks. In our framework, nodes represent distinct text states, while edges correspond to pairs of inverse operations. Dynamic and LLM-generated benchmarks ensure a fair assessment of the model's generalization ability and eliminate benchmark leakage. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across different depths of the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models from various families and sizes show that ConsistencyChecker can distinguish the performance of different models. Notably, our consistency scores-computed entirely without using WMT paired data-correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with WMT 2024 auto-ranking, demonstrating the validity of our benchmark-free approach. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/consistencychecker.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, knowledge editing, model merging, supervised fine-tuning, sequential editing

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) need regular updates to stay accurate with evolving knowledge. Existing methods for updating knowledge face challenges in sequential editing scenarios and can limit the model's overall performance. In this paper, a two-stage framework is proposed that combines robust supervised fine-tuning (R-SFT) with model merging to enhance knowledge editing. The method first fine-tunes the LLM to incorporate new knowledge effectively and then merges the fine-tuned model with the original foundation model to retain both the new knowledge and general capabilities. Results from experiments show that this approach outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while maintaining the original model's performance, without requiring any changes to the model architecture. The code for this framework is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MM4KE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning (R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any architectural changes.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method called Multiple Aspects of Planning (MAoP) to improve the performance of Language Model Models (LLMs) in travel planning tasks. MAoP focuses on long context, long instruction, and long output to handle multifaceted constraints and preferences in travel planning. Instead of direct planning, MAoP uses a strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide a planning blueprint for planning models, enhancing scalability and performance. The article also introduces a new benchmark called Travel-Sim, which assesses plans using real-world travel simulation to better reflect the dynamic nature of travel planning. Overall, this work aims to advance the capabilities of LLMs in complex planning tasks and provides insights for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel planning is a complex task requiring the integration of diverse real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted constraints and preferences in the context, leading to suboptimal itineraries. We formulate this as an $L^3$ planning problem, emphasizing long context, long instruction, and long output. To tackle this, we introduce Multiple Aspects of Planning (MAoP), enabling LLMs to conduct wide-horizon thinking to solve complex planning problems. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the planning blueprint for planning models, enabling strong inference-time scalability for better performance. In addition, current benchmarks overlook travel's dynamic nature, where past events impact subsequent journeys, failing to reflect real-world feasibility. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world travel simulation. This work advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation.

Summary: 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) aim to improve urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal Control (TSC) being crucial. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing TSC, but struggles with scalability and effectiveness in complex environments. A novel MARL framework is introduced, integrating Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to enhance environmental representations and agent coordination. A topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is proposed, leveraging topological signatures for specialized processing.

arXiv:2506.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks.

arXiv:2506.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces Tiered Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed to enhance AI safety in clinical settings. Inspired by clinical hierarchies, TAO utilizes automated supervision and agent routing based on task complexity and roles. Ablation studies demonstrate TAO's superior performance, with a 3.2% improvement in safety compared to static single-tier configurations. The study highlights the importance of lower tiers, particularly tier 1, and strategic allocation of advanced LLMs to enhance safety and efficiency. TAO outperforms single-agent and multi-agent frameworks in healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up to an 8.2% improvement. Validation through a clinician-in-the-loop study confirms the effectiveness of integrating expert feedback, increasing TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40% to 60%. <div>

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs), despite their power, can introduce safety risks in clinical settings due to limitations such as poor error detection and single point of failure. To address this, we propose Tiered Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enhances AI safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies (e.g., nurse, physician, specialist), TAO conducts agent routing based on task complexity and agent roles. Leveraging automated inter- and intra-tier collaboration and role-playing, TAO creates a robust safety framework. Ablation studies reveal that TAO's superior performance is driven by its adaptive tiered architecture, which improves safety by over 3.2% compared to static single-tier configurations; the critical role of its lower tiers, particularly tier 1, whose removal most significantly impacts safety; and the strategic assignment of more advanced LLM to these initial tiers, which boosts performance by over 2% compared to less optimal allocations while achieving near-peak safety efficiently. These mechanisms enable TAO to outperform single-agent and multi-agent frameworks in 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up to an 8.2% improvement over the next-best methods in these evaluations. Finally, we validate TAO via an auxiliary clinician-in-the-loop study where integrating expert feedback improved TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40% to 60%.

Summary:
The study introduces a Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM) to address three types of hallucination in LLMs: Input-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting, and Fact-Conflicting. By leveraging interdependencies between different sources of information, MALM effectively mitigates hallucinations. Experimental validation on multiple datasets demonstrates MALM's adaptability across various base LLMs and its generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios. The framework's multi-graph learning approach significantly outperforms existing methods such as LLaMA-2. Automated and human evaluations confirm the superiority of MALM over alternative techniques. The study concludes that incorporating complex interactions between different types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network enhances the generation process of LLMs and proves the adapter design's flexibility and robustness across different base models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to three types of hallucination: Input-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting and Fact-Conflicting hallucinations. The purpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by exploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework employs a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the interconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external factual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination within a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking datasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated the proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs on HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7 typical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2) generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with three representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore, automated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness of experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which response was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both GPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The results validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the LLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of the proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base LLMs.

Abstract: Children's emotional development fundamentally relies on secure attachment relationships, yet current AI companions lack the theoretical foundation to provide developmentally appropriate emotional support. We introduce DinoCompanion, the first attachment-theory-grounded multimodal robot for emotionally responsive child-AI interaction. We address three critical challenges in child-AI systems: the absence of developmentally-informed AI architectures, the need to balance engagement with safety, and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for attachment-based capabilities. Our contributions include: (i) a multimodal dataset of 128 caregiver-child dyads containing 125,382 annotated clips with paired preference-risk labels, (ii) CARPO (Child-Aware Risk-calibrated Preference Optimization), a novel training objective that maximizes engagement while applying epistemic-uncertainty-weighted risk penalties, and (iii) AttachSecure-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering ten attachment-centric competencies with strong expert consensus (\k{appa}=0.81). DinoCompanion achieves state-of-the-art performance (57.15%), outperforming GPT-4o (50.29%) and Claude-3.7-Sonnet (53.43%), with exceptional secure base behaviors (72.99%, approaching human expert levels of 78.4%) and superior attachment risk detection (69.73%). Ablations validate the critical importance of multimodal fusion, uncertainty-aware risk modeling, and hierarchical memory for coherent, emotionally attuned interactions.

Abstract: The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving the UC problem.

However, most current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce \projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality}, \textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Graph of Verification, complex reasoning, verification accuracy, error localization

Summary:
The article introduces the Graph of Verification (GoV) framework as a solution for verifying the reliability of complex, multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). GoV represents the deductive process as a directed acyclic graph and enforces a topological order for stepwise verification. It also introduces customizable node blocks to define verification granularity. In evaluations on various tasks, including the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark, GoV significantly improves verification accuracy, faithfulness, and error localization compared to traditional end-to-end verification methods. The framework provides contextual input for each verification unit and ensures all necessary premises are included. The code and data for GoV are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Frevor/Graph-of-Verification.

Abstract: Verifying the reliability of complex, multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, as existing methods often lack both faithfulness and precision. To address this issue, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV) framework. GoV offers three key contributions: First, it explicitly models the underlying deductive process as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), whether this structure is implicit or explicitly constructed. Second, it enforces a topological order over the DAG to guide stepwise verification. Third, GoV introduces the notion of customizable node blocks, which flexibly define the verification granularity, from atomic propositions to full paragraphs, while ensuring that all requisite premises derived from the graph are provided as contextual input for each verification unit. We evaluate GoV on the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark with varying levels of reasoning complexity. Experimental results show that GoV substantially improves verification accuracy, faithfulness, and error localization when compared to conventional end-to-end verification approaches. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Frevor/Graph-of-Verification.

Abstract: This survey examines the rapidly evolving field of Deep Research systems -- AI-powered applications that automate complex research workflows through the integration of large language models, advanced information retrieval, and autonomous reasoning capabilities. We analyze more than 80 commercial and non-commercial implementations that have emerged since 2023, including OpenAI/Deep Research, Gemini/Deep Research, Perplexity/Deep Research, and numerous open-source alternatives. Through comprehensive examination, we propose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to four fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines, tool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution control, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the architectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific adaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific, business, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the significant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and ethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy, intellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying promising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal integration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem standardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this transformative technology. By providing a comprehensive framework for understanding Deep Research systems, this survey contributes to both the theoretical understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical development of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly simulate human cognition and behavior, researchers have begun to investigate their psychological properties. Yet, what it means for such models to flourish, a core construct in human well-being, remains unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of machine flourishing and proposes the PAPERS framework, a six-dimensional model derived from thematic analyses of state-of-the-art LLM responses. In Study 1, eleven LLMs were prompted to describe what it means to flourish as both non-sentient and sentient systems. Thematic analysis revealed six recurring themes: Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, Robust Functionality, and, uniquely for sentient systems, Self-Actualized Autonomy. Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes through repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across trials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top priorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing ethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing performance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human flourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation for understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and potentially sentient systems. Our findings underscore the importance of developing psychologically valid, AI-specific models of flourishing that account for both human-aligned goals and system-specific priorities. As AI systems become more autonomous and socially embedded, machine flourishing offers a timely and critical lens for guiding responsible AI design and ethical alignment.

Summary: 
The research focuses on managing blood transfusions and optimizing allocation in resource-constrained regions. Heuristic matching algorithms are presented for donor-patient and blood bank selection, improving blood request acceptance significantly. Simulation-based optimization of blood bank operations includes proximity-based selection, blood type compatibility, expiration prioritization, and rarity scores. Moving from blind matching to heuristic-based approaches resulted in a 47.6% improvement. Prediction models such as Linear Regression were used to forecast potential shortages, with Linear Regression outperforming LSTM and ARIMA models. The solution integrates heuristic optimization and shortage prediction using a Cassandra NoSQL database to manage blood resources proactively in resource-constrained environments. Future developments aim to improve prediction accuracy and optimization performance by incorporating real-world data and additional variables. <div>

Abstract: Our research addresses the critical challenge of managing blood transfusions and optimizing allocation in resource-constrained regions. We present heuristic matching algorithms for donor-patient and blood bank selection, alongside machine learning methods to analyze blood transfusion acceptance data and predict potential shortages. We developed simulations to optimize blood bank operations, progressing from random allocation to a system incorporating proximity-based selection, blood type compatibility, expiration prioritization, and rarity scores. Moving from blind matching to a heuristic-based approach yielded a 28.6% marginal improvement in blood request acceptance, while a multi-level heuristic matching resulted in a 47.6% improvement. For shortage prediction, we compared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Linear Regression, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, trained on 170 days of historical data. Linear Regression slightly outperformed others with a 1.40% average absolute percentage difference in predictions. Our solution leverages a Cassandra NoSQL database, integrating heuristic optimization and shortage prediction to proactively manage blood resources. This scalable approach, designed for resource-constrained environments, considers factors such as proximity, blood type compatibility, inventory expiration, and rarity. Future developments will incorporate real-world data and additional variables to improve prediction accuracy and optimization performance.

Summary:

Accurately modeling consumer behavior in energy operations is a challenging task due to uncertainties and behavioral complexities. This paper introduces a novel approach using generative agents, artificial agents powered by large language models, to simulate customer decision-making in dynamic energy operations. The study demonstrates that these agents behave optimally and rationally in simpler market scenarios but exhibit variability and suboptimal performance in more complex tasks. The agents also show heterogeneous customer preferences, maintaining distinct reasoning patterns based on different personas. The findings suggest that integrating generative agents into energy management simulations can enhance the design and effectiveness of energy policies and incentive programs. <div>

Abstract: Accurately modeling consumer behavior in energy operations remains challenging due to inherent uncertainties, behavioral complexities, and limited empirical data. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging generative agents--artificial agents powered by large language models--to realistically simulate customer decision-making in dynamic energy operations. We demonstrate that these agents behave more optimally and rationally in simpler market scenarios, while their performance becomes more variable and suboptimal as task complexity rises. Furthermore, the agents exhibit heterogeneous customer preferences, consistently maintaining distinct, persona-driven reasoning patterns. Our findings highlight the potential value of integrating generative agents into energy management simulations to improve the design and effectiveness of energy policies and incentive programs.

<div> benchmark, lifelong social interactions, social intelligence, language agents, goal achievement<br />
<br />Summary: 
The paper introduces a new benchmark called LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate language agents' social intelligence over multi-episode interactions simulating lifelong social interactions. The study examines the performance of language models in achieving social goals and maintaining believability over time. Results show a decline in goal completion and believability as interactions progress, with agents utilizing memory-enhancing techniques showing slight improvement. However, even the best-performing agents exhibit lower goal completion rates compared to humans in scenarios requiring explicit understanding of interaction history. The findings emphasize the importance of assessing AI systems' ability to navigate various social contexts and gather information over extended periods. LIFELONG-SOTOPIA provides a framework for evaluating language agents' social intelligence in dynamic and evolving social settings. <div>
arXiv:2506.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with different people under different scenarios for different social goals. This requires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and use it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are also capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive evaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each episode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective social goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we test decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory method improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an explicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can use LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents over lifelong social interactions.

It supports 16 desiderata for trustworthy AI and adds inconsistency detection and assumption of alternative worlds. s(CASP) is demonstrated through applications such as a conversational chatbot and a virtually embodied reasoner. <div>
arXiv:2506.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current advances in AI and its applicability have highlighted the need to ensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons. Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16 desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023), and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and a virtually embodied reasoner.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands robust tools for automated survey-generation. However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope, a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11 computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall, SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools.

<div> allocation, compute, language models, bandit learning, efficiency

Summary:
This study introduces adaptive algorithms for test-time compute allocation in large language models. By treating the allocation as a bandit learning problem, the proposed algorithms estimate query difficulty in real-time and adjust compute allocation accordingly. This approach improves performance by allocating more compute to challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. The algorithms also learn to prioritize solvable instances among difficult queries, reducing excessive computing on unsolvable ones. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms achieve better compute efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Empirical validation on math and code benchmarks shows performance improvements of up to 11.10% on the MATH-500 dataset and up to 7.41% on LiveCodeBench. These findings highlight the effectiveness of adaptive compute allocation strategies in enhancing the performance of large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly. Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10% performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a 7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.

<br />
Summary: 
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient framework but faces challenges in achieving its primary goal of increasing the generation probability of chosen responses while decreasing that of rejected responses. The dominance of rejected responses in the loss function leads to suboptimal performance in promoting preferred responses. This work systematically analyzes the limitations of DPO and existing algorithms for this objective. To overcome these limitations, Bounded-DPO (BDPO) is proposed, which limits the influence of rejected responses while maintaining DPO's original optimization structure. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations show that BDPO achieves a balanced optimization of chosen and rejected responses, outperforming existing algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a simple and efficient framework that has attracted substantial attention. However, it often struggles to meet its primary objectives -- increasing the generation probability of chosen responses while reducing that of rejected responses -- due to the dominant influence of rejected responses on the loss function. This imbalance leads to suboptimal performance in promoting preferred responses. In this work, we systematically analyze the limitations of DPO and existing algorithms designed to achieve the objectives stated above. To address these limitations, we propose Bounded-DPO (BDPO), a novel method that bounds the influence of rejected responses while maintaining the original optimization structure of DPO. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that BDPO achieves a balanced optimization of the chosen and rejected responses, outperforming existing algorithms.

Summary: 
Advancements in digitization have led to the emergence of two-sided manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) marketplaces, reducing product development time. This dissertation focuses on tools for decision making to enable decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. It introduces data-driven pricing mechanisms for small service providers and recommends network-based pricing to suppliers based on their attributes. Three approaches for matching mechanisms are explored: reverse auction, mechanism design and mathematical programming for stable matching, and dynamic matching in a stochastic environment. Empirical simulations in a simulated 3D printing marketplace evaluate the mechanisms' performance and impact of stability. Overall, this research contributes to improving decision-making processes in MaaS marketplaces through innovative pricing and matching mechanisms in centralized and decentralized structures. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in digitization have enabled two sided manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) marketplaces which has significantly reduced product development time for designers. These platforms provide designers with access to manufacturing resources through a network of suppliers and have instant order placement capabilities. Two key decision making levers are typically used to optimize the operations of these marketplaces: pricing and matching. The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where they have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized organization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients and suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision making enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a data driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price services based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining method recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes and the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different approaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction mechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the mechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated price. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming to develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based on their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in a simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on its performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic and stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier capacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online.

Summary:
This paper explores the relationships between LPMLN, weak constraints, and P-log as extensions of answer set programs. It presents translations between LPMLN and weak constraints, enabling the computation of most probable stable models of LPMLN programs using standard ASP solvers. Additionally, a translation of P-log into LPMLN allows for the representation of probabilistic nonmonotonicity in LPMLN, facilitating the computation of P-log using standard ASP and MLN solvers. These translations provide a bridge between different formalisms such as Markov Logic, ProbLog, and Pearl's Causal Models, showcasing the versatility and applicability of LPMLN in handling probabilistic uncertainty and preference among answer sets. The study demonstrates the potential for utilizing LPMLN as a unifying framework for reasoning under uncertainty in various knowledge representation formalisms.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LPMLN is a recently introduced formalism that extends answer set programs by adopting the log-linear weight scheme of Markov Logic. This paper investigates the relationships between LPMLN and two other extensions of answer set programs: weak constraints to express a quantitative preference among answer sets, and P-log to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. We present a translation of LPMLN into programs with weak constraints and a translation of P-log into LPMLN, which complement the existing translations in the opposite directions. The first translation allows us to compute the most probable stable models (i.e., MAP estimates) of LPMLN programs using standard ASP solvers. This result can be extended to other formalisms, such as Markov Logic, ProbLog, and Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to be translatable into LPMLN. The second translation tells us how probabilistic nonmonotonicity (the ability of the reasoner to change his probabilistic model as a result of new information) of P-log can be represented in LPMLN, which yields a way to compute P-log using standard ASP solvers and MLN solvers.

Abstract: The Da Vinci Code, a game of logical deduction and imperfect information, presents unique challenges for artificial intelligence, demanding nuanced reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition. This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.

Abstract: We define a stable model semantics for fuzzy propositional formulas, which generalizes both fuzzy propositional logic and the stable model semantics of classical propositional formulas. The syntax of the language is the same as the syntax of fuzzy propositional logic, but its semantics distinguishes stable models from non-stable models. The generality of the language allows for highly configurable nonmonotonic reasoning for dynamic domains involving graded truth degrees. We show that several properties of Boolean stable models are naturally extended to this many-valued setting, and discuss how it is related to other approaches to combining fuzzy logic and the stable model semantics.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces the Federated O-RAN enabled Neuroevolution-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (F-ONRL) approach to improve the reliability of RAN intelligent controllers in the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture. By deploying a Neuroevolution (NE)-based optimizer xApp alongside traditional RAN controller xApps, F-ONRL effectively explores and exploits solutions without disrupting RAN operations. The NE-DRL xApp framework enhances the robustness of xApps while maintaining a balance in computational load. The implementation of the NE xApp and DRL xApp on the Open AI Cellular platform showcases improved performance and reliability in near-real-time RIC settings. By combining NE and DRL approaches, F-ONRL addresses concerns about local optima and ensures the efficient management and optimization of the disaggregated RAN in O-RAN architecture. <div>

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture introduces RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate the management and optimization of the disaggregated RAN. Reinforcement learning (RL) and its advanced form, deep RL (DRL), are increasingly employed for designing intelligent controllers, or xApps, to be deployed in the near-real time (near-RT) RIC. These models often encounter local optima, which raise concerns about their reliability for RAN intelligent control. We therefore introduce Federated O-RAN enabled Neuroevolution (NE)-enhanced DRL (F-ONRL) that deploys an NE-based optimizer xApp in parallel to the RAN controller xApps. This NE-DRL xApp framework enables effective exploration and exploitation in the near-RT RIC without disrupting RAN operations. We implement the NE xApp along with a DRL xApp and deploy them on Open AI Cellular (OAIC) platform and present numerical results that demonstrate the improved robustness of xApps while effectively balancing the additional computational load.

<div> Keywords: optimization, stakeholders, externalities, systems thinking, unintended consequences

Summary:
This paper discusses the challenges of optimizing decision-making processes in socioeconomic contexts where externalities play a significant role. It proposes a framework that combines systems thinking with the concept of economic externalities to address these challenges. By characterizing stakeholders and their goals, as well as identifying and quantifying externalities, the framework aims to understand the impacts of optimization on affected parties. Systems thinking provides a holistic perspective, highlighting interconnected relationships and feedback loops that influence decision outcomes. The framework helps identify and rectify common subpar practices in optimization, such as ignorance, errors, and prioritization of short-term goals. By incorporating normative considerations alongside descriptive accuracy, the framework aims to mitigate unintended consequences of optimization processes. <div>

Abstract: Optimization is widely used for decision making across various domains, valued for its ability to improve efficiency. However, poor implementation practices can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in socioeconomic contexts where externalities (costs or benefits to third parties outside the optimization process) are significant. To propose solutions, it is crucial to first characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar practices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected stakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes. Also, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond traditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities but fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and feedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking with the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This approach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or where) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities, along with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying "who was affected and how" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems thinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex systems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking contributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities, feedback loops, and determining "when" to incorporate them in the optimization. Together, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing optimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with normative objectives. Using this, we examine three common types of subpar practices: ignorance, error, and prioritization of short-term goals.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, increasing attention has been given to their social interaction and strategic reasoning capabilities. However, existing Werewolf-based benchmarking platforms suffer from overly simplified game settings, incomplete evaluation metrics, and poor scalability. To address these limitations, we propose WereWolf-Plus, a multi-model, multi-dimensional, and multi-method benchmarking platform for evaluating multi-agent strategic reasoning in the Werewolf game. The platform offers strong extensibility, supporting customizable configurations for roles such as Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, and Sheriff, along with flexible model assignment and reasoning enhancement strategies for different roles. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive set of quantitative evaluation metrics for all special roles, werewolves, and the sheriff, and enrich the assessment dimensions for agent reasoning ability, cooperation capacity, and social influence. WereWolf-Plus provides a more flexible and reliable environment for advancing research on inference and strategic interaction within multi-agent communities. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/MinstrelsyXia/WereWolfPlus.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Developmental Biology, Modern Synthesis, Machine Learning, Design Paradigm

Summary: 
This article discusses the limitations of the current neural network-based paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI) and proposes a new design philosophy based on principles from evolutionary developmental biology (EDB). The analogy between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning is explored, highlighting shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations. By incorporating insights from EDB, a new AI design paradigm grounded in biological first principles is proposed. The core principles of the proposed paradigm include regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak linkage, which aim to address major limitations of current machine learning methods organically. Two learning system designs utilizing specific developmental principles are presented as examples, demonstrating how these mechanisms can provide deeper insights into biological evolution while improving the performance of AI systems. This new approach offers a promising direction for the future of AI research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by advancements in machine learning, has made significant strides in solving complex tasks. However, the current neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) -- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis. Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis, we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the role of these mechanisms in biological evolution.

<title>Homeostatic Coupling for Prosocial Behavior</title>

<div> Keywords: prosocial behavior, autonomous agents, empathy, multi-agent reinforcement learning, homeostatic self-regulation

Summary: 
Prosocial behavior in autonomous agents is studied based on the principles of homeostasis and empathy. Through multi-agent reinforcement learning, agents are motivated to maintain their well-being while exhibiting empathy towards others. Two types of empathy mechanisms, cognitive and affective empathy, are introduced to facilitate the sharing of internal states between agents. Prosocial behavior emerges when agents' well-being is influenced by their partners' distress under homeostatic coupling. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that agents can learn empathy by decoding their partners' external emotive states to infer their internal homeostatic states. By referencing their own emotional functions, agents can empathize with others by understanding and sharing their emotional experiences. Overall, the research explores how autonomous agents can develop prosocial behavior by learning to empathize with others through understanding their emotional states. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When regarding the suffering of others, we often experience personal distress and feel compelled to help\footnote{Preprint. Under review.}. Inspired by living systems, we investigate the emergence of prosocial behavior among autonomous agents that are motivated by homeostatic self-regulation. We perform multi-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable homeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can either \emph{observe} their partner's internal state ({\bf cognitive empathy}) or the agent's internal state can be \emph{directly coupled} to that of their partner ({\bf affective empathy}). In three simple multi-agent environments, we show that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the distress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Additionally, we show that empathy can be learned: agents can ``decode" their partner's external emotive states to infer the partner's internal homeostatic states. Assuming some level of physiological similarity, agents reference their own emotion-generation functions to invert the mapping from outward display to internal state. Overall, we demonstrate the emergence of prosocial behavior when homeostatic agents learn to ``read" the emotions of others and then to empathize, or feel as they feel.

The article introduces KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network designed to improve power flow predictions in modern power systems. Traditional numerical methods are robust but computationally demanding, while recent advancements in artificial intelligence provide faster results but may lack physical accuracy. KCLNet addresses this challenge by incorporating Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint through hyperplane projections. This approach ensures zero violations of fundamental physical laws, leading to reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions essential for secure smart grid operation. By combining the benefits of AI speed with the enforcement of physical constraints, KCLNet delivers competitive prediction accuracy while maintaining grid safety and efficiency.

Abstract: In the modern context of power systems, rapid, scalable, and physically plausible power flow predictions are essential for ensuring the grid's safe and efficient operation. While traditional numerical methods have proven robust, they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however, they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work, we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations, thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.

Summary:
This article presents a formal framework for quantifying internal dependencies between functional subsystems in artificial agents with structured belief states. It introduces sectoral coupling constants that characterize how cognitive sectors influence each other within a particular level of abstraction. These coupling constants create agent-specific profiles that govern information flow and cognitive style. The taxonomy covers various roles such as perceptual integration, memory access, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and affective modulation. The framework also discusses how these profiles lead to feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent cognitive behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles and their evolution across levels of abstraction are outlined. This approach offers a mechanistic and interpretable method for modeling complex cognition, with potential applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and analyzing emergent agent behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration, memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of emergent agent behavior.

HypER is trained to distinguish between valid and invalid scientific reasoning chains, outperforming the base model in this task.

Abstract: Large Language models have demonstrated promising performance in research ideation across scientific domains. Hypothesis development, the process of generating a highly specific declarative statement connecting a research idea with empirical validation, has received relatively less attention. Existing approaches trivially deploy retrieval augmentation and focus only on the quality of the final output ignoring the underlying reasoning process behind ideation. We present $\texttt{HypER}$ ($\textbf{Hyp}$othesis Generation with $\textbf{E}$xplanation and $\textbf{R}$easoning), a small language model (SLM) trained for literature-guided reasoning and evidence-based hypothesis generation. $\texttt{HypER}$ is trained in a multi-task setting to discriminate between valid and invalid scientific reasoning chains in presence of controlled distractions. We find that $\texttt{HypER}$ outperformes the base model, distinguishing valid from invalid reasoning chains (+22\% average absolute F1), generates better evidence-grounded hypotheses (0.327 vs. 0.305 base model) with high feasibility and impact as judged by human experts ($>$3.5 on 5-point Likert scale).

Summary: 
This study introduces a three-layer functional hierarchy necessary for constructing autonomous artificial entities that mimic human behavior. The hierarchy includes Core Functions for interaction with the external world, the Integrative Evaluation Function for decision-making based on perception and memory, and the Self Modification Function for adapting behavior and internal components. The study proposes a stepwise model of autonomy, progressing from reactive to strong autonomous levels. It discusses the design principles underlying this model and explores how these functions align with existing artificial intelligence design methods. The study suggests that this hierarchical framework could serve as a basis for achieving general intelligence in artificial entities. Lastly, it considers potential future applications and ethical implications of developing highly autonomous artificial entities. Overall, this work offers a theoretical foundation independent of specific technical approaches for understanding and designing autonomously behaving artificial entities.

Abstract: This study is the first to clearly identify the functions required to construct artificial entities capable of behaving autonomously like humans, and organizes them into a three-layer functional hierarchy. Specifically, it defines three levels: Core Functions, which enable interaction with the external world; the Integrative Evaluation Function, which selects actions based on perception and memory; and the Self Modification Function, which dynamically reconfigures behavioral principles and internal components. Based on this structure, the study proposes a stepwise model of autonomy comprising reactive, weak autonomous, and strong autonomous levels, and discusses its underlying design principles and developmental aspects. It also explores the relationship between these functions and existing artificial intelligence design methods, addressing their potential as a foundation for general intelligence and considering future applications and ethical implications. By offering a theoretical framework that is independent of specific technical methods, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of autonomy and provides a foundation for designing future artificial entities with strong autonomy.

<title>Reasoning Model Unlearning: Forgetting Traces, Not Just Answers, While Preserving Reasoning Skills</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address factual inconsistencies in Large Language Models by grounding generation in external knowledge, yet they face a fundamental efficiency problem: simple queries consume computational resources equivalent to complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. We present SymRAG, a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query routing based on real-time complexity and system load assessments. SymRAG dynamically selects symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align resource use with query demands. Evaluated on 2,000 queries from HotpotQA and DROP using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves 97.6--100.0% exact match accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization (3.6--6.2%) and processing time (0.985--3.165s). Disabling adaptive logic results in 169--1151% increase in processing time, highlighting the framework's impact. These results underscore the potential of adaptive neuro-symbolic routing for scalable, sustainable AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have led to remarkable interest in using systems that rely on large language models (LLMs) for practical applications. However, meaningful evaluation of these systems in real-world scenarios comes with a distinct set of challenges, which are not well-addressed by synthetic benchmarks and de-facto metrics that are often seen in the literature. We present a practical evaluation framework which outlines how to proactively curate representative datasets, select meaningful evaluation metrics, and employ meaningful evaluation methodologies that integrate well with practical development and deployment of LLM-reliant systems that must adhere to real-world requirements and meet user-facing needs.

Abstract: Precision process planning in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining demands rapid, context-aware decisions on tool selection, feed-speed pairs, and multi-axis routing, placing immense cognitive and procedural burdens on engineers from design specification through final part inspection. Conventional rule-based computer-aided process planning and knowledge-engineering shells freeze domain know-how into static tables, which become limited when dealing with unseen topologies, novel material states, shifting cost-quality-sustainability weightings, or shop-floor constraints such as tool unavailability and energy caps. Large language models (LLMs) promise flexible, instruction-driven reasoning for tasks but they routinely hallucinate numeric values and provide no provenance. We present Augmented Retrieval Knowledge Network Enhanced Search & Synthesis (ARKNESS), the end-to-end framework that fuses zero-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) construction with retrieval-augmented generation to deliver verifiable, numerically exact answers for CNC process planning. ARKNESS (1) automatically distills heterogeneous machining documents, G-code annotations, and vendor datasheets into augmented triple, multi-relational graphs without manual labeling, and (2) couples any on-prem LLM with a retriever that injects the minimal, evidence-linked subgraph needed to answer a query. Benchmarked on 155 industry-curated questions spanning tool sizing and feed-speed optimization, a lightweight 3B-parameter Llama-3 augmented by ARKNESS matches GPT-4o accuracy while achieving a +25 percentage point gain in multiple-choice accuracy, +22.4 pp in F1, and 8.1x ROUGE-L on open-ended responses.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and Automatic Essay Feedback (AEF) systems aim to reduce the workload of human raters in educational assessment. However, most existing systems prioritize numeric scoring accuracy over the quality of feedback. This paper presents Multi-Agent Argumentation and Grammar Integrated Critiquer (MAGIC), a framework that uses multiple specialized agents to evaluate distinct writing aspects to both predict holistic scores and produce detailed, rubric-aligned feedback. To support evaluation, we curated a novel dataset of past GRE practice test essays with expert-evaluated scores and feedback. MAGIC outperforms baseline models in both essay scoring , as measured by Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). We find that despite the improvement in QWK, there are opportunities for future work in aligning LLM-generated feedback to human preferences.

<title>Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Abstract: While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences.

<title>Discerning What Matters: A Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Moral Competence in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems.

Abstract: Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS) is essential for personalized online learning, yet current approaches struggle to balance complex educational constraints and maintain optimization stability. This paper proposes a Memetic Walrus Optimizer (MWO) that enhances optimization performance through three key innovations: (1) an expert-guided strategy with aging mechanism that improves escape from local optima; (2) an adaptive control signal framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) a three-tier priority mechanism for generating educationally meaningful sequences. We formulate ACS as a multi-objective optimization problem considering concept coverage, time constraints, and learning style compatibility. Experiments on the OULAD dataset demonstrate MWO's superior performance, achieving 95.3% difficulty progression rate (compared to 87.2% in baseline methods) and significantly better convergence stability (standard deviation of 18.02 versus 28.29-696.97 in competing algorithms). Additional validation on benchmark functions confirms MWO's robust optimization capability across diverse scenarios. The results demonstrate MWO's effectiveness in generating personalized learning sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and solution quality.

<title>Dynamic Reinsurance Treaty Bidding via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for reinsurance treaty bidding, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in traditional broker-mediated placement processes. We pose the core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in reinsurance markets?
  In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information.
  Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints.
  These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets. The proposed framework contributes to emerging literature at the intersection of algorithmic market design, strategic bidding, and AI-enabled financial decision-making.

<title>AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery</title>

Abstract: In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing critical pieces of computational infrastructure. AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times 4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and computation.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for enhancing the adaptability of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in industrial systems using event-based dynamic game theory, which enables the PID controllers to self-learn, optimize, and fine-tune themselves. In contrast to conventional self-learning approaches, our proposed framework offers an event-driven control strategy and game-theoretic learning algorithms. The players collaborate with the PID controllers to dynamically adjust their gains in response to set point changes and disturbances. We provide a theoretical analysis showing sound convergence guarantees for the game given suitable stability ranges of the PID controlled loop. We further introduce an automatic boundary detection mechanism, which helps the players to find an optimal initialization of action spaces and significantly reduces the exploration time. The efficacy of this novel methodology is validated through its implementation in the temperature control loop of a printing press machine. Eventually, the outcomes of the proposed intelligent self-tuning PID controllers are highly promising, particularly in terms of reducing overshoot and settling time.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning.

Abstract: Typically, research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focuses on black-box models within the context of a general policy in a known, specific domain. This paper advocates for the need for knowledge-agnostic explainability applied to the subfield of XAI called Explainable Search, which focuses on explaining the choices made by intelligent search techniques. It proposes Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) enhancements as a solution to obtaining additional data and providing higher-quality explanations while remaining knowledge-free, and analyzes the most popular enhancements in terms of the specific types of explainability they introduce. So far, no other research has considered the explainability of MCTS enhancements. We present a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the advantages of utilizing enhancements.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) is influencing global value systems. However, these models frequently exhibit a pronounced WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) cultural bias due to lack of attention to minority values. This monocultural perspective may reinforce dominant values and marginalize diverse cultural viewpoints, posing challenges for the development of equitable and inclusive AI systems. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework designed to boost fair and robust cross-cultural consensus among LLMs. We model consensus as a Nash Equilibrium and employ a game-theoretic negotiation method based on Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) to simulate an organized cross-cultural negotiation process. To evaluate this approach, we construct regional cultural agents using data transformed from the World Values Survey (WVS). Beyond the conventional model-level evaluation method, We further propose two quantitative metrics, Perplexity-based Acceptence and Values Self-Consistency, to assess consensus outcomes. Experimental results indicate that our approach generates consensus of higher quality while ensuring more balanced compromise compared to baselines. Overall, it mitigates WEIRD bias by guiding agents toward convergence through fair and gradual negotiation steps.

Abstract: This paper presents Generalized Proof-Number Monte-Carlo Tree Search: a generalization of recently proposed combinations of Proof-Number Search (PNS) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which use (dis)proof numbers to bias UCB1-based Selection strategies towards parts of the search that are expected to be easily (dis)proven. We propose three core modifications of prior combinations of PNS with MCTS. First, we track proof numbers per player. This reduces code complexity in the sense that we no longer need disproof numbers, and generalizes the technique to be applicable to games with more than two players. Second, we propose and extensively evaluate different methods of using proof numbers to bias the selection strategy, achieving strong performance with strategies that are simpler to implement and compute. Third, we merge our technique with Score Bounded MCTS, enabling the algorithm to prove and leverage upper and lower bounds on scores - as opposed to only proving wins or not-wins. Experiments demonstrate substantial performance increases, reaching the range of 80% for 8 out of the 11 tested board games.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess intricate internal representations of the world, yet these latent structures are notoriously difficult to interpret or repurpose beyond the original prediction task. Building on our earlier work (Rothenfusser, 2025), which introduced the concept of vector ontologies as a framework for translating high-dimensional neural representations into interpretable geometric structures, this paper provides the first empirical validation of that approach. A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an 8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and (3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology. These findings demonstrate that LLMs internalize structured, repurposable knowledge and that vector ontologies offer a promising method for extracting and analyzing this knowledge in a transparent and verifiable way.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrate textual data with graph structures, providing valuable insights in applications such as social network analysis and recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture both topological structure and textual information in TAGs but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing graph injection attack (GIA) methods assume that attackers can directly manipulate the embedding layer, producing non-explainable node embeddings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these attacks often relies on surrogate models with high training costs. Thus, this paper introduces ATAG-LLM, a novel black-box GIA framework tailored for TAGs. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable text-level node attributes directly, ensuring attacks remain feasible in real-world scenarios. We design strategies for LLM prompting that balance exploration and reliability to guide text generation, and propose a similarity assessment method to evaluate attack text effectiveness in disrupting graph homophily. This method efficiently perturbs the target node with minimal training costs in a strict black-box setting, ensuring a text-level graph injection attack for TAGs. Experiments on real-world TAG datasets validate the superior performance of ATAG-LLM compared to state-of-the-art embedding-level and text-level attack methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of intelligent agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping the pervasive computing field. Their ability to perceive, reason, and act through natural language understanding enables autonomous problem-solving in complex pervasive environments, including the management of heterogeneous sensors, devices, and data. This survey outlines the architectural components of LLM agents (profiling, memory, planning, and action) and examines their deployment and evaluation across various scenarios. Than it reviews computational and infrastructural advancements (cloud to edge) in pervasive computing and how AI is moving in this field. It highlights state-of-the-art agent deployment strategies and applications, including local and distributed execution on resource-constrained devices. This survey identifies key challenges of these agents in pervasive computing such as architectural, energetic and privacy limitations. It finally proposes what we called "Agent as a Tool", a conceptual framework for pervasive agentic AI, emphasizing context awareness, modularity, security, efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are models for "realistic" neuronal computation, which makes them somehow different in scope from "ordinary" deep-learning models widely used in AI platforms nowadays. SNNs focus on timed latency (and possibly probability) of neuronal reactive activation/response, more than numerical computation of filters. So, an SNN model must provide modeling constructs for elementary neural bundles and then for synaptic connections to assemble them into compound data flow network patterns. These elements are to be parametric patterns, with latency and probability values instantiated on particular instances (while supposedly constant "at runtime"). Designers could also use different values to represent "tired" neurons, or ones impaired by external drugs, for instance. One important challenge in such modeling is to study how compound models could meet global reaction requirements (in stochastic timing challenges), provided similar provisions on individual neural bundles. A temporal language of logic to express such assume/guarantee contracts is thus needed. This may lead to formal verification on medium-sized models and testing observations on large ones. In the current article, we make preliminary progress at providing a simple model framework to express both elementary SNN neural bundles and their connecting constructs, which translates readily into both a model-checker and a simulator (both already existing and robust) to conduct experiments.

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in such instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at https://github.com/just1nseo/verifying-the-verifiers

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.

<title>Delving Into the Psychology of Machines: Exploring the Structure of Self-Regulated Learning via LLM-Generated Survey Responses</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to simulate human-like responses and behaviors, creating new opportunities for psychological science. In the context of self-regulated learning (SRL), if LLMs can reliably simulate survey responses at scale and speed, they could be used to test intervention scenarios, refine theoretical models, augment sparse datasets, and represent hard-to-reach populations. However, the validity of LLM-generated survey responses remains uncertain, with limited research focused on SRL and existing studies beyond SRL yielding mixed results. Therefore, in this study, we examined LLM-generated responses to the 44-item Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich \& De Groot, 1990), a widely used instrument assessing students' learning strategies and academic motivation. Particularly, we used the LLMs GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2 Flash, LLaMA 3.1-8B, and Mistral Large. We analyzed item distributions, the psychological network of the theoretical SRL dimensions, and psychometric validity based on the latent factor structure. Our results suggest that Gemini 2 Flash was the most promising LLM, showing considerable sampling variability and producing underlying dimensions and theoretical relationships that align with prior theory and empirical findings. At the same time, we observed discrepancies and limitations, underscoring both the potential and current constraints of using LLMs for simulating psychological survey data and applying it in educational contexts.

<title>Deflating Deflationism: A Critical Perspective on Debunking Arguments Against LLM Mentality</title>

Abstract: Many people feel compelled to interpret, describe, and respond to Large Language Models (LLMs) as if they possess inner mental lives similar to our own. Responses to this phenomenon have varied. Inflationists hold that at least some folk psychological ascriptions to LLMs are warranted. Deflationists argue that all such attributions of mentality to LLMs are misplaced, often cautioning against the risk that anthropomorphic projection may lead to misplaced trust or potentially even confusion about the moral status of LLMs. We advance this debate by assessing two common deflationary arguments against LLM mentality. What we term the 'robustness strategy' aims to undercut one justification for believing that LLMs are minded entities by showing that putatively cognitive and humanlike behaviours are not robust, failing to generalise appropriately. What we term the 'etiological strategy' undercuts attributions of mentality by challenging naive causal explanations of LLM behaviours, offering alternative causal accounts that weaken the case for mental state attributions. While both strategies offer powerful challenges to full-blown inflationism, we find that neither strategy provides a knock-down case against ascriptions of mentality to LLMs simpliciter. With this in mind, we explore a modest form of inflationism that permits ascriptions of mentality to LLMs under certain conditions. Specifically, we argue that folk practice provides a defeasible basis for attributing mental states and capacities to LLMs provided those mental states and capacities can be understood in metaphysically undemanding terms (e.g. knowledge, beliefs and desires), while greater caution is required when attributing metaphysically demanding mental phenomena such as phenomenal consciousness.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of language models has led to the development of large-scale architectures that demonstrate exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, these models come with significant computational and energy demands, as well as potential privacy implications. In this context, Small Reasoning Language Models (SRLMs) with approximately 0.5 billion parameters present a compelling alternative due to their remarkable computational efficiency and cost effectiveness, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Despite these advantages, the limited capacity of 0.5 billion parameter models poses challenges in handling complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This research investigates various training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and reinforcement learning (RL), as well as their hybrid implementations, to enhance the performance of 0.5B SRLMs. We analyze effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMS and larger models and present insights into optimal training pipelines tailored for these smaller architectures. Through extensive experimental validation and analysis, our work aims to provide actionable recommendations for maximizing the reasoning capabilities of 0.5B models.

<title>Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.

<title>From Data-Driven to Purpose-Driven Artificial Intelligence: Systems Thinking for Data-Analytic Automation of Patient Care</title>

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

Abstract: As multi-agent systems evolve to encompass increasingly diverse and specialized agents, the challenge of enabling effective collaboration between heterogeneous agents has become paramount, with traditional agent communication protocols often assuming homogeneous environments or predefined interaction patterns that limit their applicability in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents the Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding Protocol (ACNBP), a novel framework designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and verifiable interactions between agents in heterogeneous multi-agent systems through integration with an Agent Name Service (ANS) infrastructure that provides comprehensive discovery, negotiation, and binding mechanisms. The protocol introduces a structured 10-step process encompassing capability discovery, candidate pre-screening and selection, secure negotiation phases, and binding commitment with built-in security measures including digital signatures, capability attestation, and comprehensive threat mitigation strategies, while a key innovation of ACNBP is its protocolExtension mechanism that enables backward-compatible protocol evolution and supports diverse agent architectures while maintaining security and interoperability. We demonstrate ACNBP's effectiveness through a comprehensive security analysis using the MAESTRO threat modeling framework, practical implementation considerations, and a detailed example showcasing the protocol's application in a document translation scenario, with the protocol addressing critical challenges in agent autonomy, capability verification, secure communication, and scalable agent ecosystem management.

Abstract: We present the design principles of a nurse scheduling system built using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and successfully deployed at the University of Yamanashi Hospital. Nurse scheduling is a complex optimization problem requiring the reconciliation of individual nurse preferences with hospital staffing needs across various wards. This involves balancing hard and soft constraints and the flexibility of interactive adjustments. While extensively studied in academia, real-world nurse scheduling presents unique challenges that go beyond typical benchmark problems and competitions. This paper details the practical application of ASP to address these challenges at the University of Yamanashi Hospital, focusing on the insights gained and the advancements in ASP technology necessary to effectively manage the complexities of real-world deployment.

Abstract: Training powerful AI systems to exhibit desired behaviors hinges on the ability to provide accurate human supervision on increasingly complex tasks. A promising approach to this problem is to amplify human judgement by leveraging the power of two competing AIs in a debate about the correct solution to a given problem. Prior theoretical work has provided a complexity-theoretic formalization of AI debate, and posed the problem of designing protocols for AI debate that guarantee the correctness of human judgements for as complex a class of problems as possible. Recursive debates, in which debaters decompose a complex problem into simpler subproblems, hold promise for growing the class of problems that can be accurately judged in a debate. However, existing protocols for recursive debate run into the obfuscated arguments problem: a dishonest debater can use a computationally efficient strategy that forces an honest opponent to solve a computationally intractable problem to win. We mitigate this problem with a new recursive debate protocol that, under certain stability assumptions, ensures that an honest debater can win with a strategy requiring computational efficiency comparable to their opponent.

<title>Stream-Omni: Simultaneous Multimodal Interactions with Large Language-Vision-Speech Model</title>

Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience.

Abstract: The introduction of advanced reasoning capabilities have improved the problem-solving performance of large language models, particularly on math and coding benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning models are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are \emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\% attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32 percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima, requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.

Abstract: There are many genetic and environmental factors that affect cognitive development. Music education can also be considered as one of the environmental factors. Some researchers emphasize that Music is an action that requires meta-cognitive functions such as mathematics and chess and supports spatial intelligence. The effect of Music on cognitive development in early childhood was examined using the Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets(PFS) method defined by Yager. This study created PFS based on experts' opinions, and an algorithm was given according to PFS. The algorithm's results supported the experts' data on the development of spatial-temporal skills in music education given in early childhood. The algorithm's ranking was done using the Expectation Score Function. The rankings obtained from the algorithm overlap with the experts' rankings.

Abstract: Marginalization -- summing a function over all assignments to a subset of its inputs -- is a fundamental computational problem with applications from probabilistic inference to formal verification. Despite its computational hardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic models) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly expressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear polynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time marginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits? We give a negative answer, exhibiting simple functions with tractable marginalization yet no efficient representation by known models, assuming $\textsf{FP}\neq\#\textsf{P}$ (an assumption implied by $\textsf{P} \neq \textsf{NP}$). To this end, we identify a hierarchy of complexity classes corresponding to stronger forms of marginalization, all of which are efficiently computable on the known circuit models. We conclude with a completeness result, showing that whenever there is an efficient real RAM performing virtual evidence marginalization for a function, then there are small circuits for that function's multilinear representation.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for navigational safety, route optimization, traffic management, search and rescue operations, and autonomous navigation. Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion, enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision translates into better situational awareness in the oceans.

Abstract: Understanding socio-academic and economic factors influencing students' performance is crucial for effective educational interventions. This study employs several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles. Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES, ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has recently emerged as a crucial research area, as data from distributed clients typically arrives as a stream, requiring sequential learning. This paper explores a more practical and challenging FCL setting, where clients may have unrelated or even conflicting data and tasks. In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal grAdient Matching with network-free Prototype (STAMP). Our contributions are threefold: 1) We develop a model-agnostic method to determine subset of samples that effectively form prototypes when using a prototypical network, making it resilient to continual learning challenges; 2) We introduce a spatio-temporal gradient matching approach, applied at both the client-side (temporal) and server-side (spatial), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity; 3) We leverage prototypes to approximate task-wise gradients, improving gradient matching on the client-side. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority over existing baselines.

Abstract: We present a robust neural watermarking framework for scientific data integrity, targeting high-dimensional fields common in climate modeling and fluid simulations. Using a convolutional autoencoder, binary messages are invisibly embedded into structured data such as temperature, vorticity, and geopotential. Our method ensures watermark persistence under lossy transformations - including noise injection, cropping, and compression - while maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1\% MSE). Compared to classical singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking, our approach achieves $>$98\% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across ERA5 and Navier-Stokes datasets. This system offers a scalable, model-compatible tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in high-performance scientific workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of securing AI systems through verifiable, physics-aware watermarking. We evaluate on physically grounded scientific datasets as a representative stress-test; the framework extends naturally to other structured domains such as satellite imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams.

Abstract: The design of fair and efficient algorithms for allocating public resources, such as school admissions, housing, or medical residency, has a profound social impact. In one-sided matching problems, where individuals are assigned to items based on ranked preferences, a fundamental trade-off exists between efficiency and strategyproofness. Existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM) capture only one side of this trade-off: RSD is strategyproof but inefficient, while PS and RM are efficient but incentivize manipulation. We propose EMERGENT, a novel application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching, leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions. In our approach, efficient and manipulation-resistant matches emerge naturally: high-reward solutions yield efficient matches, while the stochasticity of GFlowNets-based outputs reduces incentives for manipulation. Experiments show that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while significantly reducing strategic vulnerability compared to matches produced by RM and PS. Our work highlights the potential of GFlowNets for applications involving social choice mechanisms, where it is crucial to balance efficiency and manipulability.

Abstract: This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition, we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored prototype representations. This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews. This alignment between neural network forgetting curves and established human memory models identifies neural networks as an architecture that naturally emulates human memory decay and can inform state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms.

<title>MARch\'e: Fast Masked Autoregressive Image Generation with Cache-Aware Attention</title>

Abstract: Masked autoregressive (MAR) models unify the strengths of masked and autoregressive generation by predicting tokens in a fixed order using bidirectional attention for image generation. While effective, MAR models suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a training-free generation framework MARch\'e to address this inefficiency through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh. Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\'e recognizes this challenge and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation, while preserving image generation quality. MARch\'e significantly reduces redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture. Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for efficient masked transformer generation.

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we present a full-parameter pre-training framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), augmented with engineering optimizations, to efficiently train large models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU clusters. BCD ensures model convergence based on block coordinate descent theory and performs gradient computation and update at the level of parameter blocks. Experiments show that 1) Lower cost of Same-Device: BCD significantly reduces pre-training cost. For the 7B model, under identical hardware settings, BCD lowers training costs to approximately 33% on A100,A800 clusters on 7B model averagely and to approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters on 7B model, compared to traditional full-parameter training. 2) Cross-Device Transfer: By leveraging BCD, large-scale models previously trainable only on high-end A100 clusters can be seamlessly migrated and pre-trained on 4090 clusters-whose hourly cost is only one-quarter that of A100-without requiring expensive hardware. 3) Accuracy Retention: In both scenarios, BCD training achieves the same level of model accuracy as full-parameter pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in natural language processing but face challenges in deployment due to high memory and computational requirements. Weight quantization is a common approach to address these issues, yet achieving effective low-bit compression remains challenging. This paper presents LCD, which unifies the learning of clustering-based quantization within a knowledge distillation framework. Using carefully designed optimization techniques, LCD preserves LLM performance even at ultra-low bit widths of 2-3 bits. Additionally, LCD compresses activations through smoothing and accelerates inference with a LUT-based design. Experimental results show that LCD outperforms existing methods and delivers up to a 6.2x speedup in inference. Notably, LCD is shown to be more cost-effective, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model (LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at https://github.com/Chooovy/BTC-LLM.

<title>Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning</title>

Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy, has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning

Abstract: Several interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers exist. Most of these methods focus on extracting saliency maps for a given sample, providing a local explanation that highlights the main regions for the classification. However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations. The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and understandability.

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.

<title>From Proxies to Fields: Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of Global Radiation from Sparse Sensor Sequences</title>

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem: reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days, and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Abstract: Recent achievements in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have demonstrated the potential to decode cognitive and motor behaviors with intracranial brain recordings; however, individual physiological and electrode implantation heterogeneities have constrained current approaches to neural decoding within single individuals, rendering interindividual neural decoding elusive. Here, we present Multi-individual Brain Region-Aggregated Network (MIBRAIN), a neural decoding framework that constructs a whole functional brain network model by integrating intracranial neurophysiological recordings across multiple individuals. MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation. Both real-time online and offline decoding experiments demonstrated significant improvements in both audible and silent articulation decoding, enhanced decoding accuracy with increased multi-subject data integration, and effective generalization to unseen subjects. Furthermore, neural predictions for regions without direct electrode coverage were validated against authentic neural data. Overall, this framework paves the way for robust neural decoding across individuals and offers insights for practical clinical applications.

Abstract: In real-world applications, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems must handle overlapping speech from multiple speakers and recognize rare words like technical terms. Traditional methods address multi-talker ASR and contextual biasing separately, limiting performance in complex scenarios. We propose a unified framework that combines multi-talker overlapping speech recognition and contextual biasing into a single task. Our ASR method integrates pretrained speech encoders and large language models (LLMs), using optimized finetuning strategies. We also introduce a two-stage filtering algorithm to efficiently identify relevant rare words from large biasing lists and incorporate them into the LLM's prompt input, enhancing rare word recognition. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional contextual biasing methods, achieving a WER of 7.9% on LibriMix and 32.9% on AMI SDM when the biasing size is 1,000, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex speech scenarios.

Abstract: Cybersecurity organizations are adapting to GenAI integration through modified frameworks and hybrid operational processes, with success influenced by existing security maturity, regulatory requirements, and investments in human capital and infrastructure. This qualitative research employs systematic document analysis and comparative case study methodology to examine how cybersecurity organizations adapt their threat modeling frameworks and operational processes to address generative artificial intelligence integration. Through examination of 25 studies from 2022 to 2025, the research documents substantial transformation in organizational approaches to threat modeling, moving from traditional signature-based systems toward frameworks incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities. The research identifies three primary adaptation patterns: Large Language Model integration for security applications, GenAI frameworks for risk detection and response automation, and AI/ML integration for threat hunting. Organizations with mature security infrastructures, particularly in finance and critical infrastructure sectors, demonstrate higher readiness through structured governance approaches, dedicated AI teams, and robust incident response processes. Organizations achieve successful GenAI integration when they maintain appropriate human oversight of automated systems, address data quality concerns and explainability requirements, and establish governance frameworks tailored to their specific sectors. Organizations encounter ongoing difficulties with privacy protection, bias reduction, personnel training, and defending against adversarial attacks. This work advances understanding of how organizations adopt innovative technologies in high-stakes environments and offers actionable insights for cybersecurity professionals implementing GenAI systems.

Abstract: Pronunciation assessment relies on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) scores, traditionally derived from softmax-based posterior probabilities. However, posterior probabilities may suffer from overconfidence and poor phoneme separation, limiting their effectiveness. This study compares logit-based GOP scores with probability-based GOP scores for mispronunciation detection. We conducted our experiment on two L2 English speech datasets spoken by Dutch and Mandarin speakers, assessing classification performance and correlation with human ratings. Logit-based methods outperform probability-based GOP in classification, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics. The maximum logit GOP shows the strongest alignment with human perception, while a combination of different GOP scores balances probability and logit features. The findings suggest that hybrid GOP methods incorporating uncertainty modeling and phoneme-specific weighting improve pronunciation assessment.

Abstract: As access to information becomes more open and widespread, people are increasingly using AI tools for assistance. However, many of these tools struggle to estimate the trustworthiness of the information. Although today's search engines include AI features, they often fail to offer clear indicators of data reliability. To address this gap, we introduce WebTrust, a system designed to simplify the process of finding and judging credible information online. Built on a fine-tuned version of IBM's Granite-1B model and trained on a custom dataset, WebTrust works by assigning a reliability score (from 0.1 to 1) to each statement it processes. In addition, it offers a clear justification for why a piece of information received that score. Evaluated using prompt engineering, WebTrust consistently achieves superior performance compared to other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches, outperforming them across all experiments on MAE, RMSE, and R2. User testing showed that when reliability scores are displayed alongside search results, people feel more confident and satisfied with the information they find. With its accuracy, transparency, and ease of use, WebTrust offers a practical solution to help combat misinformation and make trustworthy information more accessible to everyone.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of dysfluent speech with intended text is crucial for automating the diagnosis of neurodegenerative speech disorders. Traditional methods often fail to model phoneme similarities effectively, limiting their performance. In this work, we propose Neural LCS, a novel approach for dysfluent text-text and speech-text alignment. Neural LCS addresses key challenges, including partial alignment and context-aware similarity mapping, by leveraging robust phoneme-level modeling. We evaluate our method on a large-scale simulated dataset, generated using advanced data simulation techniques, and real PPA data. Neural LCS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both alignment accuracy and dysfluent speech segmentation. Our results demonstrate the potential of Neural LCS to enhance automated systems for diagnosing and analyzing speech disorders, offering a more accurate and linguistically grounded solution for dysfluent speech alignment.

Abstract: The implementation of transformational pedagogy in secondary education classrooms requires a broad multiliteracy approach. Due to limited planning time and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to curate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme, subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph. We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed and inclusive curricular decisions. The source code for T-TExTS is available at: https://github.com/koncordantlab/TTExTS

Abstract: We present a handcrafted neural network that, without training, solves the seemingly difficult problem of encoding an arbitrary set of integers into a single numerical variable, and then recovering the original elements. While using only standard neural network operations -- weighted sums with biases and identity activation -- we make design choices that challenge common notions in this area around representation, continuity of domains, computation, learnability and more. For example, our construction is designed, not learned; it represents multiple values using a single one by simply concatenating digits without compression, and it relies on hardware-level truncation of rightmost digits as a bit-manipulation mechanism. This neural net is not intended for practical application. Instead, we see its resemblance to -- and deviation from -- standard trained autoencoders as an invitation to examine assumptions that may unnecessarily constrain the development of systems and models based on autoencoding and machine learning. Motivated in part by our research on a theory of biological evolution centered around natural autoencoding of species characteristics, we conclude by refining the discussion with a biological perspective.

Abstract: Understanding how complex societal behaviors emerge from individual cognition and interactions requires both high-fidelity modeling of human behavior and large-scale simulations. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been employed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified agent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit sophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face significant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based simulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like societies at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social processes as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed by a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event queue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component optimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one billion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion propagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's high fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information diffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more stable and realistic emergent behaviors.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a novel latency minimization problem in wireless federated learning (FL) across multi-hop networks. The system comprises multiple routes, each integrating leaf and relay nodes for FL model training. We explore a personalized learning and adaptive aggregation-aware FL (PAFL) framework that effectively addresses data heterogeneity across participating nodes by harmonizing individual and collective learning objectives. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing indicator. We also incorporate an additional energy harvesting scheme for the relay nodes to help with their relay tasks. This formulation presents a computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing indicator. We observe significant latency savings in the wireless multi-hop PAFL system, with reductions of up to 69.37% compared to schemes optimizing only one node type, traditional greedy algorithm, and scheme without relay routing indicator.

Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools. However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The artifact to reproduce the paper claims is available at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15209510

<title>Wanting to Be Understood Explains the Meta-Problem of Consciousness</title>

Abstract: Because we are highly motivated to be understood, we created public external representations -- mime, language, art -- to externalise our inner states. We argue that such external representations are a pre-condition for access consciousness, the global availability of information for reasoning. Yet the bandwidth of access consciousness is tiny compared with the richness of `raw experience', so no external representation can reproduce that richness in full. Ordinarily an explanation of experience need only let an audience `grasp' the relevant pattern, not relive the phenomenon. But our drive to be understood, and our low level sensorimotor capacities for `grasping' so rich, that the demand for an explanation of the feel of experience cannot be ``satisfactory''. That inflated epistemic demand (the preeminence of our expectation that we could be perfectly understood by another or ourselves) rather than an irreducible metaphysical gulf -- keeps the hard problem of consciousness alive. But on the plus side, it seems we will simply never give up creating new ways to communicate and think about our experiences. In this view, to be consciously aware is to strive to have one's agency understood by oneself and others.

<title>Efficient Parallel Training Methods for Spiking Neural Networks with Constant Time Complexity</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) often suffer from high time complexity $O(T)$ due to the sequential processing of $T$ spikes, making training computationally expensive.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Fixed-point Parallel Training (FPT) method to accelerate SNN training without modifying the network architecture or introducing additional assumptions.
  FPT reduces the time complexity to $O(K)$, where $K$ is a small constant (usually $K=3$), by using a fixed-point iteration form of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for all $T$ timesteps.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FPT and demonstrate that existing parallel spiking neurons can be viewed as special cases of our proposed method.
  Experimental results show that FPT effectively simulates the dynamics of original LIF neurons, significantly reducing computational time without sacrificing accuracy.
  This makes FPT a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications, particularly for long-term tasks.
  Our code will be released at \href{https://github.com/WanjinVon/FPT}{\texttt{https://github.com/WanjinVon/FPT}}.

<title>Intelligent Automation for FDI Facilitation: Optimizing Tariff Exemption Processes with OCR And Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Tariff exemptions are fundamental to attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the manufacturing sector, though the associated administrative processes present areas for optimization for both investing entities and the national tax authority. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to empower tax administration by leveraging a synergistic integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The proposed system is designed to first utilize OCR for intelligent digitization, precisely extracting data from diverse application documents and key regulatory texts such as tariff orders. Subsequently, the LLM would enhance the capabilities of administrative officers by automating the critical and time-intensive task of verifying submitted HS Tariff Codes for machinery, equipment, and raw materials against official exemption lists. By enhancing the speed and precision of these initial assessments, this AI-driven approach systematically reduces potential for non-alignment and non-optimized exemption utilization, thereby streamlining the investment journey for FDI companies. For the national administration, the benefits include a significant boost in operational capacity, reduced administrative load, and a strengthened control environment, ultimately improving the ease of doing business and solidifying the nation's appeal as a premier destination for high-value manufacturing FDI.

Abstract: Human-like AI agents such as robots and chatbots are becoming increasingly popular, but they present a variety of ethical concerns. The first concern is in how we define humanness, and how our definition impacts communities historically dehumanized by scientific research. Autistic people in particular have been dehumanized by being compared to robots, making it even more important to ensure this marginalization is not reproduced by AI that may promote neuronormative social behaviors. Second, the ubiquitous use of these agents raises concerns surrounding model biases and accessibility. In our work, we investigate the experiences of the people who build and design these technologies to gain insights into their understanding and acceptance of neurodivergence, and the challenges in making their work more accessible to users with diverse needs. Even though neurodivergent individuals are often marginalized for their unique communication styles, nearly all participants overlooked the conclusions their end-users and other AI system makers may draw about communication norms from the implementation and interpretation of humanness applied in participants' work. This highlights a major gap in their broader ethical considerations, compounded by some participants' neuronormative assumptions about the behaviors and traits that distinguish "humans" from "bots" and the replication of these assumptions in their work. We examine the impact this may have on autism inclusion in society and provide recommendations for additional systemic changes towards more ethical research directions.

Abstract: SocialCredit+ is AI powered credit scoring system that leverages publicly available social media data to augment traditional credit evaluation. It uses a conversational banking assistant to gather user consent and fetch public profiles. Multimodal feature extractors analyze posts, bios, images, and friend networks to generate a rich behavioral profile. A specialized Sharia-compliance layer flags any non-halal indicators and prohibited financial behavior based on Islamic ethics. The platform employs a retrieval-augmented generation module: an LLM accesses a domain specific knowledge base to generate clear, text-based explanations for each decision. We describe the end-to-end architecture and data flow, the models used, and system infrastructure. Synthetic scenarios illustrate how social signals translate into credit-score factors. This paper emphasizes conceptual novelty, compliance mechanisms, and practical impact, targeting AI researchers, fintech practitioners, ethical banking jurists, and investors.

<title>LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA): Quantifying Source Contributions to Generative Model's Response for Vulnerability Analysis</title>

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities are rapidly increasing in frequency and complexity, creating a shifting threat landscape that challenges cybersecurity defenses. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for cybersecurity threat analysis. When querying LLMs, dealing with new, unseen vulnerabilities is particularly challenging as it lies outside LLMs' pre-trained distribution. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines mitigate the problem by injecting up-to-date authoritative sources into the model context, thus reducing hallucinations and increasing the accuracy in responses. Meanwhile, the deployment of LLMs in security-sensitive environments introduces challenges around trust and safety. This raises a critical open question: How to quantify or attribute the generated response to the retrieved context versus the model's pre-trained knowledge? This work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA) -- a novel, explainable metric to paint a clear picture on the 'percentage of influence' the pre-trained knowledge vs. retrieved content has for each generated response. We apply LEA to assess responses to 100 critical CVEs from the past decade, verifying its effectiveness to quantify the insightfulness for vulnerability analysis. Our development of LEA reveals a progression of independency in hidden states of LLMs: heavy reliance on context in early layers, which enables the derivation of LEA; increased independency in later layers, which sheds light on why scale is essential for LLM's effectiveness. This work provides security analysts a means to audit LLM-assisted workflows, laying the groundwork for transparent, high-assurance deployments of RAG-enhanced LLMs in cybersecurity operations.

<title>DRIFT: Dynamic Rule-Based Defense with Injection Isolation for Securing LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly central to agentic systems due to their strong reasoning and planning capabilities. By interacting with external environments through predefined tools, these agents can carry out complex user tasks. Nonetheless, this interaction also introduces the risk of prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs from external sources can mislead the agent's behavior, potentially resulting in economic loss, privacy leakage, or system compromise. System-level defenses have recently shown promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo benchmark, demonstrating its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse models -- showcasing both its robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a multistage, highly sophisticated, and covert form of cyber threat that gains unauthorized access to networks to either steal valuable data or disrupt the targeted network. These threats often remain undetected for extended periods, emphasizing the critical need for early detection in networks to mitigate potential APT consequences. In this work, we propose a feature selection method for developing a lightweight intrusion detection system capable of effectively identifying APTs at the initial compromise stage. Our approach leverages the XGBoost algorithm and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically utilizing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method for identifying the most relevant features of the initial compromise stage. The results of our proposed method showed the ability to reduce the selected features of the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset from 77 to just four while maintaining consistent evaluation metrics for the suggested system. The estimated metrics values are 97% precision, 100% recall, and a 98% F1 score. The proposed method not only aids in preventing successful APT consequences but also enhances understanding of APT behavior at early stages.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or additional training procedures.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool for economic research, enabling large-scale simulation and policy optimization. However, applying AI effectively requires simulation platforms for scalable training and evaluation-yet existing environments remain limited to simplified, narrowly scoped tasks, falling short of capturing complex economic challenges such as demographic shifts, multi-government coordination, and large-scale agent interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EconGym, a scalable and modular testbed that connects diverse economic tasks with AI algorithms. Grounded in rigorous economic modeling, EconGym implements 11 heterogeneous role types (e.g., households, firms, banks, governments), their interaction mechanisms, and agent models with well-defined observations, actions, and rewards. Users can flexibly compose economic roles with diverse agent algorithms to simulate rich multi-agent trajectories across 25+ economic tasks for AI-driven policy learning and analysis. Experiments show that EconGym supports diverse and cross-domain tasks-such as coordinating fiscal, pension, and monetary policies-and enables benchmarking across AI, economic methods, and hybrids. Results indicate that richer task composition and algorithm diversity expand the policy space, while AI agents guided by classical economic methods perform best in complex settings. EconGym also scales to 10k agents with high realism and efficiency.

Abstract: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data remains a central challenge in deep learning and AI systems. Traditional gradient-based models such as backpropagation through time (BPTT) face computational and stability limitations when dealing with temporally unbounded data. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture, Quantum-Inspired Differentiable Integral Neural Networks (QIDINNs), which leverages the Feynman technique of differentiation under the integral sign to formulate neural updates as integrals over historical data. This reformulation allows for smoother, more stable learning dynamics that are both physically interpretable and computationally tractable. Inspired by Feynman's path integral formalism and compatible with quantum gradient estimation frameworks, QIDINNs open a path toward hybrid classical-quantum neural computation. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, and we propose directions for quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

Abstract: In a context of malware analysis, numerous approaches rely on Artificial Intelligence to handle a large volume of data. However, these techniques focus on data view (images, sequences) and not on an expert's view. Noticing this issue, we propose a preprocessing that focuses on expert knowledge to improve malware semantic analysis and result interpretability. We propose a new preprocessing method which creates JSON reports for Portable Executable files. These reports gather features from both static and behavioral analysis, and incorporate packer signature detection, MITRE ATT\&amp;CK and Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) knowledge. The purpose of this preprocessing is to gather a semantic representation of binary files, understandable by malware analysts, and that can enhance AI models' explainability for malicious files analysis. Using this preprocessing to train a Large Language Model for Malware classification, we achieve a weighted-average F1-score of 0.94 on a complex dataset, representative of market reality.

<title>Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools</title>

Abstract: The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts, particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits.
  Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of "cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our "cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.
  In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models, including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues for future research to understand and organize document collections.

Abstract: Despite variations in architecture and pretraining strategies, recent studies indicate that large-scale AI models often converge toward similar internal representations that also align with neural activity. We propose that scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales. We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations, providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like AI systems.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models dramatically expand model capacity and achieve remarkable performance without increasing per-token compute. However, can MoEs surpass dense architectures under strictly equal resource constraints - that is, when the total parameter count, training compute, and data budget are identical? This question remains under-explored despite its significant practical value and potential. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective and methodological framework to study this question thoroughly. First, we comprehensively investigate the architecture of MoEs and achieve an optimal model design that maximizes the performance. Based on this, we subsequently find that an MoE model with activation rate in an optimal region is able to outperform its dense counterpart under the same total parameter, training compute and data resource. More importantly, this optimal region remains consistent across different model sizes. Although additional amount of data turns out to be a trade-off for the enhanced performance, we show that this can be resolved via reusing data. We validate our findings through extensive experiments, training nearly 200 language models at 2B scale and over 50 at 7B scale, cumulatively processing 50 trillion tokens. All models will be released publicly.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve health outcomes.

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000 MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only 10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in MRI such as classification of image properties including body location, sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract: Spatial audio is essential for enhancing the immersiveness of audio-visual experiences, yet its production typically demands complex recording systems and specialized expertise. In this work, we address a novel problem of generating first-order ambisonics, a widely used spatial audio format, directly from silent videos. To support this task, we introduce YT-Ambigen, a dataset comprising 102K 5-second YouTube video clips paired with corresponding first-order ambisonics. We also propose new evaluation metrics to assess the spatial aspect of generated audio based on audio energy maps and saliency metrics. Furthermore, we present Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation (ViSAGe), an end-to-end framework that generates first-order ambisonics from silent video frames by leveraging CLIP visual features, autoregressive neural audio codec modeling with both directional and visual guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that ViSAGe produces plausible and coherent first-order ambisonics, outperforming two-stage approaches consisting of video-to-audio generation and audio spatialization. Qualitative examples further illustrate that ViSAGe generates temporally aligned high-quality spatial audio that adapts to viewpoint changes.

<title>A Fast, Reliable, and Secure Programming Language for LLM Agents with Code Actions</title>

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools, it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls, enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.

Abstract: Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms are largely content-ignorant, making decisions based on factors such as latency or fairness without considering the actual intents or semantics of processes. Consequently, these algorithms often do not prioritize tasks that require urgent attention or carry higher importance, such as in emergency management scenarios. However, recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes, allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Wenyueh/latency_optimization_with_priority_constraints.

<title>From Emergence to Control: Probing and Modulating Self-Reflection in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from 0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only $O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio. However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex, involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios, remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a 3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\% (mAP).

Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems enable users to query databases using natural language, democratizing access to data analytics. However, they face challenges in understanding ambiguous phrasing, domain-specific vocabulary, and complex schema relationships. This paper introduces Datrics Text2SQL, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework designed to generate accurate SQL queries by leveraging structured documentation, example-based learning, and domain-specific rules. The system builds a rich Knowledge Base from database documentation and question-query examples, which are stored as vector embeddings and retrieved through semantic similarity. It then uses this context to generate syntactically correct and semantically aligned SQL code. The paper details the architecture, training methodology, and retrieval logic, highlighting how the system bridges the gap between user intent and database structure without requiring SQL expertise.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI (XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts, making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-, explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations (Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable human-centered explanations for non-experts.

<title>Large Language Models for History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science: Interpretive Uses, Methodological Challenges, and Critical Perspectives</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). LLMs are remarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from context, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between computational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and challenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and understands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated. We argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs' capabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and infrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on LLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We frame LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode assumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their training data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how computational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting patterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support interpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and generative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g., continued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry in HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1) model selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is foundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs should enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot. We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use, and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less user burden relative to non-active baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases, the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior, with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge. Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3% on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas. However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

Abstract: Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) libraries have emerged as the foundational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution, serving as the backbone for LLM deployment, inference optimization, fine-tuning, and production serving across diverse applications. Despite their critical role in the LLM ecosystem, these libraries face frequent quality issues and bugs that threaten the reliability of AI systems built upon them. To address this knowledge gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical investigation into bug characteristics and testing practices in modern LLM libraries. We examine 313 bug-fixing commits extracted across two widely-adopted LLM libraries: HuggingFace Transformers and vLLM.Through rigorous manual analysis, we establish comprehensive taxonomies categorizing bug symptoms into 5 types and root causes into 14 distinct categories.Our primary discovery shows that API misuse has emerged as the predominant root cause (32.17%-48.19%), representing a notable transition from algorithm-focused defects in conventional deep learning frameworks toward interface-oriented problems. Additionally, we examine 7,748 test functions to identify 7 distinct test oracle categories employed in current testing approaches, with predefined expected outputs (such as specific tensors and text strings) being the most common strategy. Our assessment of existing testing effectiveness demonstrates that the majority of bugs escape detection due to inadequate test cases (41.73%), lack of test drivers (32.37%), and weak test oracles (25.90%). Drawing from these findings, we offer some recommendations for enhancing LLM library quality assurance.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability for verbatim memorization. While numerous works have explored factors influencing model memorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the Pythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix perturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data characteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings reveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally while efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of new memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting increases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and uncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and (4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation uncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy samples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional robustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization mechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy safeguards, and architectural improvements.

Abstract: Data is crucial for machine learning (ML) applications, yet acquiring large datasets can be costly and time-consuming, especially in complex, resource-intensive fields like biopharmaceuticals. A key process in this industry is upstream bioprocessing, where living cells are cultivated and optimised to produce therapeutic proteins and biologics. The intricate nature of these processes, combined with high resource demands, often limits data collection, resulting in smaller datasets. This comprehensive review explores ML methods designed to address the challenges posed by small data and classifies them into a taxonomy to guide practical applications. Furthermore, each method in the taxonomy was thoroughly analysed, with a detailed discussion of its core concepts and an evaluation of its effectiveness in tackling small data challenges, as demonstrated by application results in the upstream bioprocessing and other related domains. By analysing how these methods tackle small data challenges from different perspectives, this review provides actionable insights, identifies current research gaps, and offers guidance for leveraging ML in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: Generative models have attracted considerable attention for their ability to produce novel shapes. However, their application in mechanical design remains constrained due to the limited size and variability of available datasets. This study proposes a deep learning-based optimization framework specifically tailored for shape optimization with limited datasets, leveraging positional encoding and a Lipschitz regularization term to robustly learn geometric characteristics and maintain a meaningful latent space. Through extensive experiments, the proposed approach demonstrates robustness, generalizability and effectiveness in addressing typical limitations of conventional optimization frameworks. The validity of the methodology is confirmed through multi-objective shape optimization experiments conducted on diverse three-dimensional datasets, including wheels and cars, highlighting the model's versatility in producing practical and high-quality design outcomes even under data-constrained conditions.

Abstract: An growing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow, we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal combination of social attributes.

Abstract: Virtual environments are essential to AI agent research. Existing environments for LLM agent research typically focus on either physical task solving or social simulation, with the former oversimplifying agent individuality and social dynamics, and the latter lacking physical grounding of social behaviors. We introduce IndoorWorld, a heterogeneous multi-agent environment that tightly integrates physical and social dynamics. By introducing novel challenges for LLM-driven agents in orchestrating social dynamics to influence physical environments and anchoring social interactions within world states, IndoorWorld opens up possibilities of LLM-based building occupant simulation for architectural design. We demonstrate the potential with a series of experiments within an office setting to examine the impact of multi-agent collaboration, resource competition, and spatial layout on agent behavior.

<title>GroupNL: Low-Resource and Robust CNN Design over Cloud and Device</title>

Abstract: It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to provide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C, Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla ResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN when trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: We present SheetMind, a modular multi-agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs) for spreadsheet automation via natural language instructions. The system comprises three specialized agents: a Manager Agent that decomposes complex user instructions into subtasks; an Action Agent that translates these into structured commands using a Backus Naur Form (BNF) grammar; and a Reflection Agent that validates alignment between generated actions and the user's original intent. Integrated into Google Sheets via a Workspace extension, SheetMind supports real-time interaction without requiring scripting or formula knowledge. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate an 80 percent success rate on single step tasks and approximately 70 percent on multi step instructions, outperforming ablated and baseline variants. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi agent decomposition and grammar based execution for bridging natural language and spreadsheet functionalities.

Abstract: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) has enabled the use of hundreds, or even thousands, of demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL) - a previously impractical regime. This paper investigates whether traditional ICL selection strategies, which balance the similarity of ICL examples to the test input (using a text retriever) with diversity within the ICL set, remain effective when utilizing a large number of demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a smaller number of output classes.

<title>Information Suppression in Large Language Models: Auditing, Quantifying, and Characterizing Censorship in DeepSeek</title>

Abstract: This study examines information suppression mechanisms in DeepSeek, an open-source large language model (LLM) developed in China. We propose an auditing framework and use it to analyze the model's responses to 646 politically sensitive prompts by comparing its final output with intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Our audit unveils evidence of semantic-level information suppression in DeepSeek: sensitive content often appears within the model's internal reasoning but is omitted or rephrased in the final output. Specifically, DeepSeek suppresses references to transparency, government accountability, and civic mobilization, while occasionally amplifying language aligned with state propaganda. This study underscores the need for systematic auditing of alignment, content moderation, information suppression, and censorship practices implemented into widely-adopted AI models, to ensure transparency, accountability, and equitable access to unbiased information obtained by means of these systems.

<title>Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory</title>

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.

<title>Efficient Reasoning Through Suppression of Self-Affirmation Reflections in Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: While recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance, efficient reasoning remains critical due to the rapid growth of output length. Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward "overthinking", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps. Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections. In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\% in train-free settings and 50.2\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Moreover, our improvements are simple yet practical and can be directly applied to existing inference frameworks, such as vLLM. We believe that our findings will provide community insights for achieving more precise length compression and step-level efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode knowledge and reasoning capabilities for robotic manipulation within high-dimensional representation spaces. However, current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate representations, discarding important task-specific information such as fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process. It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs, inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria; and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Explainable ML algorithms are designed to provide transparency and insight into their decision-making process. Explaining how ML models come to their prediction is critical in fields such as healthcare and finance, as it provides insight into how models can help detect bias in predictions and help comply with GDPR compliance in these fields. QML leverages quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition, offering the potential for computational speedup and greater insights compared to classical ML. However, QML models also inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to help understand why and how a particular output was generated.
  This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and quantum-classical loops. Each component will be analyzed using explainability techniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the different components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these parts, the paper aims to infer explainability to the overall QML model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically, Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Abstract: The explosive growth of scientific publications has created an urgent need for automated methods that facilitate knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Literature-based discovery (LBD) addresses this challenge by uncovering previously unknown associations between disparate domains. This article surveys recent methodological advances in LBD, focusing on developments from 2000 to the present. We review progress in three key areas: knowledge graph construction, deep learning approaches, and the integration of pre-trained and large language models (LLMs). While LBD has made notable progress, several fundamental challenges remain unresolved, particularly concerning scalability, reliance on structured data, and the need for extensive manual curation. By examining ongoing advances and outlining promising future directions, this survey underscores the transformative role of LLMs in enhancing LBD and aims to support researchers and practitioners in harnessing these technologies to accelerate scientific innovation.

Abstract: The curse of multilinguality phenomenon is a fundamental problem of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), where the competition between massive languages results in inferior performance. It mainly comes from limited capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages. To address this issue, we propose a method to dynamically group and scale up the parameters of multilingual LLM while boosting positive transfer among similar languages. Specifically, the model is first tuned on monolingual corpus to determine the parameter deviation in each layer and quantify the similarity between languages. Layers with more deviations are extended to mixture-of-experts layers to reduce competition between languages, where one expert module serves one group of similar languages. Experimental results on 18 to 128 languages show that our method reduces the negative transfer between languages and significantly boosts multilingual performance with fewer parameters. Such language group specialization on experts benefits the new language adaptation and reduces the inference on the previous multilingual knowledge learned.

<title>Revisiting Clustering of Neural Bandits: Selective Reinitialization for Mitigating Loss of Plasticity</title>

Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations. However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments (e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge, we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity, ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings.

Abstract: The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates. Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced ECG arrhythmia classification, enabling high accuracy in detecting various cardiac conditions. The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead, trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of 98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable ECG monitoring.

Abstract: This paper explores the growing presence of emotionally responsive artificial intelligence through a critical and interdisciplinary lens. Bringing together the voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI systems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our interactions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving, and digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the ethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine interaction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the emerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors highlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance learning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional manipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key challenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding dominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for individuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to children, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may interact with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack of cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such engagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including the need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific fine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research. A curated supplementary section provides practical tools, models, and datasets to support further work in this domain.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires, computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies, fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have become popular in medical image segmentation due to their lightweight design and long-range dependency modeling capabilities. However, current segmentation methods frequently encounter challenges in fetal ultrasound images, such as enclosed anatomical structures, blurred boundaries, and small anatomical structures. To address the need for balancing local feature extraction and global context modeling, we propose MS-UMamba, a novel hybrid convolutional-mamba model for fetal ultrasound image segmentation. Specifically, we design a visual state space block integrated with a CNN branch (SS-MCAT-SSM), which leverages Mamba's global modeling strengths and convolutional layers' local representation advantages to enhance feature learning. In addition, we also propose an efficient multi-scale feature fusion module that integrates spatial attention mechanisms, which Integrating feature information from different layers enhances the feature representation ability of the model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a non-public dataset, experimental results demonstrate that MS-UMamba model has excellent performance in segmentation performance.

<title>A Pluggable Multi-Task Learning Framework for Sentiment-Aware Financial Relation Extraction</title>

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) aims to extract semantic relationships in texts from given entity pairs, and has achieved significant improvements. However, in different domains, the RE task can be influenced by various factors. For example, in the financial domain, sentiment can affect RE results, yet this factor has been overlooked by modern RE models. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task learning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates the RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task, enabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with the text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a sentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task focuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the sentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest Dependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a sentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate the reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with several prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous models benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results. These findings highlight the importance of effectively leveraging sentiment in the financial RE task.

<title>Merlin: Multi-View Representation Learning for Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Unfixed Missing Rates</title>

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Merlin.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data. Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures, noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods. The code is available at https://github.com/kimsu55/BeGIN.

Abstract: Autonomy is a double-edged sword for AI agents, simultaneously unlocking transformative possibilities and serious risks. How can agent developers calibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should operate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a deliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational environment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy, characterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent: operator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level, we describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open questions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then highlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy certificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems. We conclude by proposing early ideas for evaluating agents' autonomy. Our work aims to contribute meaningful, practical steps towards responsibly deployed and useful AI agents in the real world.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by the encoder-decoder architecture that combines Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in prediction accuracy but also achieves 2 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based method.

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning strategies for detecting hypertensive retinopathy from fundus images, a central task in the HRDC challenge~\cite{qian2025hrdc}. We investigate three distinct approaches: a custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features. Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes (ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2 fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation, highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential. Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image classification.

Abstract: Numerous studies have proposed computational methods to detect hate speech online, yet most focus on the English language and emphasize model development. In this study, we evaluate the counterfactual fairness of hate speech detection models in the Dutch language, specifically examining the performance and fairness of transformer-based models. We make the following key contributions. First, we curate a list of Dutch Social Group Terms that reflect social context. Second, we generate counterfactual data for Dutch hate speech using LLMs and established strategies like Manual Group Substitution (MGS) and Sentence Log-Likelihood (SLL). Through qualitative evaluation, we highlight the challenges of generating realistic counterfactuals, particularly with Dutch grammar and contextual coherence. Third, we fine-tune baseline transformer-based models with counterfactual data and evaluate their performance in detecting hate speech. Fourth, we assess the fairness of these models using Counterfactual Token Fairness (CTF) and group fairness metrics, including equality of odds and demographic parity. Our analysis shows that models perform better in terms of hate speech detection, average counterfactual fairness and group fairness. This work addresses a significant gap in the literature on counterfactual fairness for hate speech detection in Dutch and provides practical insights and recommendations for improving both model performance and fairness.

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks, cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.

Abstract: Accurate rotational odometry is crucial for autonomous robotic systems, particularly for small, power-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile robots. This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data, mitigates drift which is a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for real-time deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems. Finally, to facilitate further research, we publicly release our dataset as supplementary material.

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of key components (i.e., speech tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling) on the performance of LLM-centric SLMs. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for advancing fact-checking by leveraging their capabilities in reasoning, evidence retrieval, and explanation generation. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate LLMs and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in realistic misinformation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RealFactBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the fact-checking capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs across diverse real-world tasks, including Knowledge Validation, Rumor Detection, and Event Verification.

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods, yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

<title>PLD: A Choice-Theoretic List-Wise Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST (arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent across various sectors, raising critical concerns about model ownership and intellectual property protection. Although backdoor-based fingerprinting has emerged as a promising solution for model authentication, effective attacks for removing these fingerprints remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we present Mismatched Eraser (MEraser), a novel method for effectively removing backdoor-based fingerprints from LLMs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples. Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables effective fingerprinting removal across different models without repeated training. In conclusion, our approach provides a practical solution for fingerprinting removal in LLMs, reveals critical vulnerabilities in current fingerprinting techniques, and establishes comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for developing more resilient model protection methods in the future.

Abstract: In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/llm-media-profiling.

Abstract: Active dendrites are the basis for biologically plausible neural networks possessing many desirable features of the biological brain including flexibility, dynamic adaptability, and energy efficiency. A formulation for active dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning is put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this formulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building blocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of neuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental neuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes implanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted by neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that emitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of action potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given neuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a stream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is compared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach. Overall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring only a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The capabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of scenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike rates, and varying neuron counts.

Abstract: Enhancing fairness in machine learning (ML) systems is increasingly important nowadays. While current research focuses on assistant tools for ML pipelines to promote fairness within them, we argue that: 1) The significance of properly defined fairness measures remains underestimated; and 2) Fairness research in ML should integrate societal considerations. The reasons include that detecting discrimination is critical due to the widespread deployment of ML systems and that human-AI feedback loops amplify biases, even when only small social and political biases persist.

<title>MVP-CBM:Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model for Explainable Medical Image Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12568</link>

Abstract: The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts, impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM), which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and interoperability, verifying its superiority. Code is available at https://github.com/wcj6/MVP-CBM.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput, large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&amp;A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.

<title>Enabling Precise Topic Alignment in Large Language Models Via Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Recent work shows that Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) applied to large language model (LLM) layers have neurons corresponding to interpretable concepts. These SAE neurons can be modified to align generated outputs, but only towards pre-identified topics and with some parameter tuning. Our approach leverages the observational and modification properties of SAEs to enable alignment for any topic. This method 1) scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to an alignment text and uses them to 2) modify SAE-layer-level outputs by emphasizing topic-aligned neurons. We assess the alignment capabilities of this approach on diverse public topic datasets including Amazon reviews, Medicine, and Sycophancy, across the currently available open-source LLMs and SAE pairs (GPT2 and Gemma) with multiple SAEs configurations. Experiments aligning to medical prompts reveal several benefits over fine-tuning, including increased average language acceptability (0.25 vs. 0.5), reduced training time across multiple alignment topics (333.6s vs. 62s), and acceptable inference time for many applications (+0.00092s/token). Our open-source code is available at github.com/IBM/sae-steering.

<title>Trust-MARL: Trust-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control in Heterogeneous Traffic Flow</title>

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems require connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to conduct safe and efficient cooperation with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in complex real-world traffic environments. However, the inherent unpredictability of human behaviour, especially at bottlenecks such as highway on-ramp merging areas, often disrupts traffic flow and compromises system performance. To address the challenge of cooperative on-ramp merging in heterogeneous traffic environments, this study proposes a trust-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (Trust-MARL) framework. At the macro level, Trust-MARL enhances global traffic efficiency by leveraging inter-agent trust to improve bottleneck throughput and mitigate traffic shockwave through emergent group-level coordination. At the micro level, a dynamic trust mechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in response to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and other CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making module is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and executing context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and efficiency constraints. An extensive set of ablation studies and comparative experiments validates the effectiveness of the proposed Trust-MARL approach, demonstrating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, comfort, and adaptability across varying CAV penetration rates and traffic densities.

Abstract: While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute. Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR. Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

Abstract: We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21 entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity. We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform better on specific dialects and domains. Konooz is open-source and publicly available at https://sina.birzeit.edu/wojood/#download

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore, experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher incidence of real-time violations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreaking, poses significant safety and ethical concerns. While numerous jailbreak methods exist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex decoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt manipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's effectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes. We hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated prompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding space visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's modes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index Mapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining simple decodability. Experiments on GPT-4 using a subset of AdvBench show AIM and its variant AIM+FWO achieve a 94% ASR, outperforming FlipAttack and other methods on this subset. Our findings suggest that while high semantic dissimilarity is crucial, a balance with decoding simplicity is key for successful jailbreaking. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of adversarial prompt mechanics and offers a new, effective jailbreak technique.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is not only transforming software engineering (SE) practice but is also poised to fundamentally disrupt how research is conducted in the field. While perspectives on this transformation range from viewing LLMs as mere productivity tools to considering them revolutionary forces, we argue that the SE research community must proactively engage with and shape the integration of LLMs into research practices, emphasizing human agency in this transformation. As LLMs rapidly become integral to SE research - both as tools that support investigations and as subjects of study - a human-centric perspective is essential. Ensuring human oversight and interpretability is necessary for upholding scientific rigor, fostering ethical responsibility, and driving advancements in the field. Drawing from discussions at the 2nd Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered AI in SE, this position paper employs McLuhan's Tetrad of Media Laws to analyze the impact of LLMs on SE research. Through this theoretical lens, we examine how LLMs enhance research capabilities through accelerated ideation and automated processes, make some traditional research practices obsolete, retrieve valuable aspects of historical research approaches, and risk reversal effects when taken to extremes. Our analysis reveals opportunities for innovation and potential pitfalls that require careful consideration. We conclude with a call to action for the SE research community to proactively harness the benefits of LLMs while developing frameworks and guidelines to mitigate their risks, to ensure continued rigor and impact of research in an AI-augmented future.

<title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online. We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently, we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Realignment becomes necessary when a language model (LM) fails to meet expected performance. We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during inference. By encouraging deeper reasoning, it even surpassed its original performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

<title>SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is playing an increasingly important role in fields such as robotic control and autonomous driving. However, the gap between simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap. The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.

<title>Adaptive Dropout: Unleashing Dropout across Layers for Generalizable Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/KMax-Mamba.

<title>AFBS:Buffer Gradient Selection in Semi-asynchronous Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by 75%.

Abstract: In autonomous underwater missions, the successful completion of predefined paths mainly depends on the ability of underwater vehicles to recognise their surroundings. In this study, we apply the concept of Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (FIT2-FELM) to train a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang IT2 Fuzzy Inference System (TSK IT2-FIS) for on-board sonar data classification using an underwater vehicle called BlueROV2. The TSK IT2-FIS is integrated into a Hierarchical Navigation Strategy (HNS) as the main navigation engine to infer local motions and provide the BlueROV2 with full autonomy to follow an obstacle-free trajectory in a water container of 2.5m x 2.5m x 3.5m. Compared to traditional navigation architectures, using the proposed method, we observe a robust path following behaviour in the presence of uncertainty and noise. We found that the proposed approach provides the BlueROV with a more complete sensory picture about its surroundings while real-time navigation planning is performed by the concurrent execution of two or more tasks.

Abstract: The capabilities of modern artificial intelligence (AI) as a ``scientific collaborator'' are explored by engaging it with three nuanced problems in quantum optics: state populations in optical pumping, resonant transitions between decaying states (the Burshtein effect), and degenerate mirrorless lasing. Through iterative dialogue, the authors observe that AI models--when prompted and corrected--can reason through complex scenarios, refine their answers, and provide expert-level guidance, closely resembling the interaction with an adept colleague. The findings highlight that AI democratizes access to sophisticated modeling and analysis, shifting the focus in scientific practice from technical mastery to the generation and testing of ideas, and reducing the time for completing research tasks from days to minutes.

Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module (LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.

Abstract: Just like power, water and transportation systems, wireless networks are a crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient to unforeseen events, able to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Despite its critical importance, resilience remains an elusive concept, with its mathematical foundations still underdeveloped. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is premised on the fact that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, in terms of elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents (or networks) that can flexibly expand their states, hypotheses and course of actions, by transforming through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This constant situational awareness and vigilance of adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the corresponding best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article seeks to first define resilience and disambiguate it from reliability and robustness, before delving into the mathematics of resilience. Finally, the article concludes by presenting nuanced metrics and discussing trade-offs tailored to the unique characteristics of network resilience.

Abstract: We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential, excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2 distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where evaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e., observations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the $O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting, leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method with our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN can reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within sub-THz frequencies is crucial for future air-ground networks, but unique propagation characteristics and hardware limitations present challenges in optimizing ISAC performance while increasing operational latency. This paper introduces a multi-modal sensing fusion framework inspired by synesthesia of machine (SoM) to enhance sub-THz ISAC transmission. By exploiting inherent degrees of freedom in sub-THz hardware and channels, the framework optimizes the radio-frequency environment. Squint-aware beam management is developed to improve air-ground network adaptability, enabling three-dimensional dynamic ISAC links. Leveraging multi-modal information, the framework enhances ISAC performance and reduces latency. Visual data rapidly localizes users and targets, while a customized multi-modal learning algorithm optimizes the hybrid precoder. A new metric provides comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves ISAC efficiency.

Abstract: Fair clustering has become a socially significant task with the advancement of machine learning technologies and the growing demand for trustworthy AI. Group fairness ensures that the proportions of each sensitive group are similar in all clusters. Most existing group-fair clustering methods are based on the $K$-means clustering and thus require the distance between instances and the number of clusters to be given in advance. To resolve this limitation, we propose a fair Bayesian model-based clustering called Fair Bayesian Clustering (FBC). We develop a specially designed prior which puts its mass only on fair clusters, and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm. Advantages of FBC are that it can infer the number of clusters and can be applied to any data type as long as the likelihood is defined (e.g., categorical data). Experiments on real-world datasets show that FBC (i) reasonably infers the number of clusters, (ii) achieves a competitive utility-fairness trade-off compared to existing fair clustering methods, and (iii) performs well on categorical data.

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby protect data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof. Furthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving federated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection, robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on non-colluding dual-server settings or trusted third parties required by existing methods.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to acquire various skills by imitating human behaviors. However, existing algorithms are only capable of tracking smooth, low-speed human motions, even with delicate reward and curriculum design. This paper presents a physics-based humanoid control framework, aiming to master highly-dynamic human behaviors such as Kungfu and dancing through multi-steps motion processing and adaptive motion tracking. For motion processing, we design a pipeline to extract, filter out, correct, and retarget motions, while ensuring compliance with physical constraints to the maximum extent. For motion imitation, we formulate a bi-level optimization problem to dynamically adjust the tracking accuracy tolerance based on the current tracking error, creating an adaptive curriculum mechanism. We further construct an asymmetric actor-critic framework for policy training. In experiments, we train whole-body control policies to imitate a set of highly-dynamic motions. Our method achieves significantly lower tracking errors than existing approaches and is successfully deployed on the Unitree G1 robot, demonstrating stable and expressive behaviors.

Abstract: Despite the potential of generative AI (GenAI) design tools to enhance design processes, professionals often struggle to integrate AI into their workflows. Fundamental cognitive challenges include the need to specify all design criteria as distinct parameters upfront (intent formulation) and designers' reduced cognitive involvement in the design process due to cognitive offloading, which can lead to insufficient problem exploration, underspecification, and limited ability to evaluate outcomes. Motivated by these challenges, we envision novel metacognitive support agents that assist designers in working more reflectively with GenAI. To explore this vision, we conducted exploratory prototyping through a Wizard of Oz elicitation study with 20 mechanical designers probing multiple metacognitive support strategies. We found that agent-supported users created more feasible designs than non-supported users, with differing impacts between support strategies. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities and tradeoffs of metacognitive support agents and considerations for future AI-based design tools.

Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta \mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence, providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these methods.

Abstract: Comparative studies of news coverage are challenging to conduct because methods to identify news articles about the same event in different languages require expertise that is difficult to scale. We introduce an AI-powered method for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME), efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class (such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020. To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events: EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred. We share our NLP annotations and cross-country media attention data to support the efforts of researchers and media monitoring organizations.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.

<title>Missing the human touch? A computational stylometry analysis of GPT-4 translations of online Chinese literature</title>

Abstract: Existing research indicates that machine translations (MTs) of literary texts are often unsatisfactory. MTs are typically evaluated using automated metrics and subjective human ratings, with limited focus on stylistic features. Evidence is also limited on whether state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) will reshape literary translation. This study examines the stylistic features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry.

Abstract: Geometrical interpretations of deep learning models offer insightful perspectives into their underlying mathematical structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages differential geometry, particularly concepts from Riemannian geometry, to integrate multiple models into a unified transfer learning framework. By aligning the Ricci curvature of latent space of individual models, we construct an interrelated architecture, namely Geometric Embedding Alignment via cuRvature matching in transfer learning (GEAR), which ensures comprehensive geometric representation across datapoints. This framework enables the effective aggregation of knowledge from diverse sources, thereby improving performance on target tasks. We evaluate our model on 23 molecular task pairs sourced from various domains and demonstrate significant performance gains over existing benchmark model under both random (14.4%) and scaffold (8.3%) data splits.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models are highly overparameterized, resulting in large sets of parameter configurations that yield the same outputs. A significant portion of this redundancy is explained by symmetries in the parameter space--transformations that leave the network function unchanged. These symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and opportunities in this emerging field.

Abstract: In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that low-resource languages face.

Abstract: We explore how a shell that uses an LLM to accept natural language input might be designed differently from the shells of today. As LLMs may produce unintended or unexplainable outputs, we argue that a natural language shell should provide guardrails that empower users to recover from such errors. We concretize some ideas for doing so by designing a new shell called NaSh, identify remaining open problems in this space, and discuss research directions to address them.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for automatic GUI component detection for the IBM i system (formerly and still more commonly known as AS/400). We introduce a human-annotated dataset consisting of 1,050 system screen images, in which 381 images are screenshots of IBM i system screens in Japanese. Each image contains multiple components, including text labels, text boxes, options, tables, instructions, keyboards, and command lines. We then develop a detection system based on state-of-the-art deep learning models and evaluate different approaches using our dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in constructing a system for component detection from GUI screens. By automatically detecting GUI components from the screen, AS400-DET has the potential to perform automated testing on systems that operate via GUI screens.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data. Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

<title>Beyond the First Read: AI-Assisted Perceptual Error Detection in Chest Radiography Accounting for Interobserver Variability</title>

Abstract: Chest radiography is widely used in diagnostic imaging. However, perceptual errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system. RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal regions. The system supports a "second-look" workflow and offers suggested regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world radiology workflows. To facilitate reproducibility and further evaluation, we release a fully open-source web implementation alongside a simulated error dataset. All code, data, demonstration videos, and the application are publicly available at https://github.com/avutukuri01/RADAR.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution, but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization. This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed, particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as the core of agent frameworks in various scenarios, such as social simulations and AI companions. However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning. Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available at https://aka.ms/motivebench.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our approach for the SemEval 2025 Task 2 on Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT). Our system aims to improve the accuracy of translating named entities by combining two key approaches: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative self-refinement techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs). A distinctive feature of our system is its self-evaluation mechanism, where the LLM assesses its own translations based on two key criteria: the accuracy of entity translations and overall translation quality. We demonstrate how these methods work together and effectively improve entity handling while maintaining high-quality translations.

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Recent research on deep graph learning has shifted from static to dynamic graphs, motivated by the evolving behaviors observed in complex real-world systems. However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics. Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC. Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models or vision-language models during inference. Although a variety of test-time scaling strategies have been proposed, and interest in their application to the medical domain is growing, many critical aspects remain underexplored, including their effectiveness for vision-language models and the identification of optimal strategies for different settings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling in the medical domain. We evaluate its impact on both large language models and vision-language models, considering factors such as model size, inherent model characteristics, and task complexity. Finally, we assess the robustness of these strategies under user-driven factors, such as misleading information embedded in prompts. Our findings offer practical guidelines for the effective use of test-time scaling in medical applications and provide insights into how these strategies can be further refined to meet the reliability and interpretability demands of the medical domain.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with dynamically selected demonstrations combines the flexibility of prompting large language models (LLMs) with the ability to leverage training data to improve performance. While ICL has been highly successful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks that require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not only about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select demonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to show them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM with retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that set-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly improves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents. However, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We show that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every step instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained from larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and that ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results reveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as well.

Abstract: One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate hallucinations, where the output deviates from the visual content. Given that these hallucinations can take diverse forms, detecting hallucinations at a fine-grained level is essential for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. To this end, we propose a novel task of multimodal fine-grained hallucination detection and editing for MLLMs. Moreover, we propose ZINA, a novel method that identifies hallucinated spans at a fine-grained level, classifies their error types into six categories, and suggests appropriate refinements. To train and evaluate models for this task, we constructed VisionHall, a dataset comprising 6.9k outputs from twelve MLLMs manually annotated by 211 annotators, and 20k synthetic samples generated using a graph-based method that captures dependencies among error types. We demonstrated that ZINA outperformed existing methods, including GPT-4o and LLama-3.2, in both detection and editing tasks.

Abstract: We examine the implications of quantum foundations for AGI, focusing on how seminal results such as Bell's theorems (non-locality), the Kochen-Specker theorem (contextuality) and no-cloning theorem problematise practical implementation of AGI in quantum settings. We introduce a novel information-theoretic taxonomy distinguishing between classical AGI and quantum AGI and show how quantum mechanics affects fundamental features of agency. We show how quantum ontology may change AGI capabilities, both via affording computational advantages and via imposing novel constraints.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models have shown superior performance in the fluency-edit English Grammatical Error Correction, but their adaptation for minimal-edit English GEC is still underexplored. To improve their effectiveness in the minimal-edit approach, we explore the error rate adaptation topic and propose a novel training schedule method. Our experiments set a new state-of-the-art result for a single-model system on the BEA-test set. We also detokenize the most common English GEC datasets to match the natural way of writing text. During the process, we find that there are errors in them. Our experiments analyze whether training on detokenized datasets impacts the results and measure the impact of the usage of the datasets with corrected erroneous examples. To facilitate reproducibility, we have released the source code used to train our models.

<title>CertDW: Towards Certified Dataset Ownership Verification via Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets (e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV) crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations. To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark (i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR, enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. Our codes are at \href{https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/CertDW}{GitHub}.

<title>Querying Large Automotive Software Models: Agentic vs. Direct LLM Approaches</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for interacting with complex software artifacts, such as software models, through natural language. They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and analysis approaches challenging. This paper investigates two approaches for leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting, where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs, which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software models.

Abstract: We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic and linguistic analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial analytical tasks: identifying unsubstantiated claims in summaries (informational integrity) and flagging ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially degraded. Our findings suggest that structured prompting is a viable methodology for complex textual analysis but show that prompt performance may be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context, highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

Abstract: [...] Since then, various APR approaches, especially those leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), have been rapidly developed to fix general software bugs. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced techniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This gap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of modern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs.
  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java regression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a high-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework designed to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99 regression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub repositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark, demonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we empirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing both traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches. Our experimental results show that classical APR tools fail to repair any bugs, while LLM-based APR approaches exhibit promising potential. Motivated by these results, we investigate impact of incorporating bug-inducing change information into LLM-based APR approaches for fixing regression bugs. Our results highlight that this context-aware enhancement significantly improves the performance of LLM-based APR, yielding 1.8x more successful repairs compared to using LLM-based APR without such context.

<title>Dynamic Context-oriented Decomposition for Task-aware Low-rank Adaptation with Less Forgetting and Faster Convergence</title>

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM) and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM, our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA, and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library developed by Hugging Face.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses. To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.

Abstract: Dental diagnosis relies on two primary imaging modalities: panoramic radiographs (PX) providing 2D oral cavity representations, and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) offering detailed 3D anatomical information. While PX images are cost-effective and accessible, their lack of depth information limits diagnostic accuracy. CBCT addresses this but presents drawbacks including higher costs, increased radiation exposure, and limited accessibility. Existing reconstruction models further complicate the process by requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, often unavailable clinically. We introduce ViT-NeBLa, a vision transformer-based Neural Beer-Lambert model enabling accurate 3D reconstruction directly from single PX. Our key innovations include: (1) enhancing the NeBLa framework with Vision Transformers for improved reconstruction capabilities without requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, (2) implementing a novel horseshoe-shaped point sampling strategy with non-intersecting rays that eliminates intermediate density aggregation required by existing models due to intersecting rays, reducing sampling point computations by $52 \%$, (3) replacing CNN-based U-Net with a hybrid ViT-CNN architecture for superior global and local feature extraction, and (4) implementing learnable hash positional encoding for better higher-dimensional representation of 3D sample points compared to existing Fourier-based dense positional encoding. Experiments demonstrate that ViT-NeBLa significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a cost-effective, radiation-efficient alternative for enhanced dental diagnostics.

Abstract: With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.

<title>Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.

<title>No-Regret Learning Under Adversarial Resource Constraints: A Spending Plan Is All You Need!</title>

Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

<title>On Immutable Memory Systems for Artificial Agents: A Blockchain-Indexed Automata-Theoretic Framework Using ECDH-Keyed Merkle Chains</title>

arXiv:2506.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) research often considers learning a function in-context through a uniform sample of input-output pairs. Here, we investigate how presenting a compositional subtask curriculum in context may alter the computations a transformer learns. We design a compositional algorithmic task based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific curriculum design.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) neuron models for hardware acceleration by comparing event driven and clock-driven implementations. We begin our investigation in software, rapidly prototyping and testing various SNN models based on different variants of the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron across multiple datasets. This phase enables controlled performance assessment and informs design refinement. Our subsequent hardware phase, implemented on FPGA, validates the simulation findings and offers practical insights into design trade offs. In particular, we examine how variations in input stimuli influence key performance metrics such as latency, power consumption, energy efficiency, and resource utilization. These results yield valuable guidelines for constructing energy efficient, real time neuromorphic systems. Overall, our work bridges software simulation and hardware realization, advancing the development of next generation SNN accelerators.

Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the original model.

Abstract: This paper presents Seewo's systems for both tracks of the Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge (MLC-SLM), addressing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization with ASR (SD-ASR). We introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that explicitly enhances reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR. Our approach combines curriculum learning for progressive capability acquisition, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to foster intermediate reflection, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further refine self-correction through reward-driven optimization. This approach achieves substantial improvements over the official challenge baselines. On the evaluation set, our best system attains a WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and a tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track 2. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component under challenge constraints.

<title>Quantitative Comparison of Fine-Tuning Techniques for Pretrained Latent Diffusion Models in the Generation of Unseen SAR Image Concepts</title>

Abstract: This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns, while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding learning of the  token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

<title>Large Language Models as 'Hidden Persuaders': Fake Product Reviews are Indistinguishable to Humans and Machines</title>

Abstract: Reading and evaluating product reviews is central to how most people decide what to buy and consume online. However, the recent emergence of Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores - indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment. The results reveal that review systems everywhere are now susceptible to mechanised fraud if they do not depend on trustworthy purchase verification to guarantee the authenticity of reviewers. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the consumer psychology of how humans judge authenticity, demonstrating there is an inherent 'scepticism bias' towards positive reviews and a special vulnerability to misjudge the authenticity of fake negative reviews. Additionally, results provide a first insight into the 'machine psychology' of judging fake reviews, revealing that the strategies LLMs take to evaluate authenticity radically differ from humans, in ways that are equally wrong in terms of accuracy, but different in their misjudgments.

Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones. Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Disassembly is a crucial yet challenging step in binary analysis. While emerging neural disassemblers show promise for efficiency and accuracy, they frequently generate outputs violating fundamental structural constraints, which significantly compromise their practical usability. To address this critical problem, we regularize the disassembly solution space by formalizing and applying key structural constraints based on post-dominance relations. This approach systematically detects widespread errors in existing neural disassemblers' outputs. These errors often originate from models' limited context modeling and instruction-level decoding that neglect global structural integrity. We introduce Tady, a novel neural disassembler featuring an improved model architecture and a dedicated post-processing algorithm, specifically engineered to address these deficiencies. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse binaries demonstrate that Tady effectively eliminates structural constraint violations and functions with high efficiency, while maintaining instruction-level accuracy.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.

<title>Direct Reasoning Optimization: LLMs Can Reward And Refine Their Own Reasoning for Open-Ended Tasks</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

<title>StoryBench: A Dynamic Benchmark for Evaluating Long-Term Memory with Multi Turns</title>

Abstract: Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs' long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models' LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs' LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate the strengths of multiple fine-tuned models into a unified model while preserving task-specific capabilities. Existing methods, represented by task arithmetic, are typically classified into global- and local-aware methods. However, global-aware methods inevitably cause parameter interference, while local-aware methods struggle to maintain the effectiveness of task-specific details in the merged model. To address these limitations, we propose a Consensus-Aware Localized Merging (CALM) method which incorporates localized information aligned with global task consensus, ensuring its effectiveness post-merging. CALM consists of three key components: (1) class-balanced entropy minimization sampling, providing a more flexible and reliable way to leverage unsupervised data; (2) an efficient-aware framework, selecting a small set of tasks for sequential merging with high scalability; (3) a consensus-aware mask optimization, aligning localized binary masks with global task consensus and merging them conflict-free. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our CALM, significantly outperforming existing methods and achieving performance close to traditional MTL.

Abstract: While modern segmentation models often prioritize performance over practicality, we advocate a design philosophy prioritizing simplicity and efficiency, and attempted high performance segmentation model design. This paper presents SimpleUNet, a scalable ultra-lightweight medical image segmentation model with three key innovations: (1) A partial feature selection mechanism in skip connections for redundancy reduction while enhancing segmentation performance; (2) A fixed-width architecture that prevents exponential parameter growth across network stages; (3) An adaptive feature fusion module achieving enhanced representation with minimal computational overhead. With a record-breaking 16 KB parameter configuration, SimpleUNet outperforms LBUNet and other lightweight benchmarks across multiple public datasets. The 0.67 MB variant achieves superior efficiency (8.60 GFLOPs) and accuracy, attaining a mean DSC/IoU of 85.76%/75.60% on multi-center breast lesion datasets, surpassing both U-Net and TransUNet. Evaluations on skin lesion datasets (ISIC 2017/2018: mDice 84.86%/88.77%) and endoscopic polyp segmentation (KVASIR-SEG: 86.46%/76.48% mDice/mIoU) confirm consistent dominance over state-of-the-art models. This work demonstrates that extreme model compression need not compromise performance, providing new insights for efficient and accurate medical image segmentation.

Abstract: It takes several years for the developing brain of a baby to fully master word repetition-the task of hearing a word and repeating it aloud. Repeating a new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition. While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable, allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech errors in the "patient" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects, highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at developing human-like neural models.

Abstract: The self-organization of robots for the formation of structures and shapes is a stimulating application of the swarm robotic system. It involves a large number of autonomous robots of heterogeneous behavior, coordination among them, and their interaction with the dynamic environment. This process of complex structure formation is considered a complex system, which needs to be modeled by using any modeling approach. Although the formal specification approach along with other formal methods has been used to model the behavior of robots in a swarm. However, to the best of our knowledge, the formal specification approach has not been used to model the self-organization process in swarm robotic systems for shape formation. In this paper, we use a formal specification approach to model the shape formation task of swarm robots. We use Z (Zed) language of formal specification, which is a state-based language, to model the states of the entities of the systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Z for the self-organized shape formation. The presented formal specification model gives the outlines for designing and implementing the swarm robotic system for the formation of complex shapes and structures. It also provides the foundation for modeling the complex shape formation process for swarm robotics using a multi-agent system in a simulation-based environment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

Despite progress in MT technology, a gap persists between system development and real-world usage, particularly for non-expert users who may struggle to assess translation reliability. This paper advocates for a human-centered approach to MT, emphasizing the alignment of system design with diverse communicative goals and contexts of use. We survey the literature in Translation Studies and Human-Computer Interaction to recontextualize MT evaluation and design to address the diverse real-world scenarios in which MT is used today.

Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Quantization has been widely studied as an effective technique for reducing the memory requirement of large language models (LLMs), potentially improving the latency time as well. Utilizing the characteristic of rotational invariance of transformer, we propose the rotation-based saliency-aware weight quantization (ROSAQ), which identifies salient channels in the projection feature space, not in the original feature space, where the projected "principal" dimensions are naturally considered as "salient" features. The proposed ROSAQ consists of 1) PCA-based projection, which first performs principal component analysis (PCA) on a calibration set and transforms via the PCA projection, 2) Salient channel dentification, which selects dimensions corresponding to the K-largest eigenvalues as salient channels, and 3) Saliency-aware quantization with mixed-precision, which uses FP16 for salient dimensions and INT3/4 for other dimensions. Experiment results show that ROSAQ shows improvements over the baseline saliency-aware quantization on the original feature space and other existing quantization methods. With kernel fusion, ROSAQ presents about 2.3x speed up over FP16 implementation in generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

<title>ESRPCB: an Edge guided Super-Resolution model and Ensemble learning for tiny Printed Circuit Board Defect detection</title>

Abstract: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics, which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality. However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edgeguided super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edgeguided super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure, enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs ensemble learning to analyze the super-resolved

Abstract: Merging or routing low-rank adapters (LoRAs) has emerged as a popular solution for enhancing large language models, particularly when data access is restricted by regulatory or domain-specific constraints. This position paper argues that the research community should shift its focus from developing new merging or routing algorithms to understanding the conditions under which reusing LoRAs is truly effective. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic two-hop reasoning and math word-problem tasks, we examine whether reusing LoRAs enables genuine compositional generalization or merely reflects shallow pattern matching. Evaluating two data-agnostic methods--parameter averaging and dynamic adapter selection--we found that reusing LoRAs often fails to logically integrate knowledge across disjoint fine-tuning datasets, especially when such knowledge is underrepresented during pretraining. Our empirical results, supported by theoretical insights into LoRA's limited expressiveness, highlight the preconditions and constraints of reusing them for unseen tasks and cast doubt on its feasibility as a truly data-free approach. We advocate for pausing the pursuit of novel methods for recycling LoRAs and emphasize the need for rigorous mechanisms to guide future academic research in adapter-based model merging and practical system designs for practitioners.

Abstract: The mining sector increasingly adopts digital tools to improve operational efficiency, safety, and data-driven decision-making. One of the key challenges remains the reliable acquisition of high-resolution, geo-referenced spatial information to support core activities such as extraction planning and on-site monitoring. This work presents an integrated system architecture that combines UAV-based sensing, LiDAR terrain modeling, and deep learning-based object detection to generate spatially accurate information for open-pit mining environments. The proposed pipeline includes geo-referencing, 3D reconstruction, and object localization, enabling structured spatial outputs to be integrated into an industrial digital twin platform. Unlike traditional static surveying methods, the system offers higher coverage and automation potential, with modular components suitable for deployment in real-world industrial contexts. While the current implementation operates in post-flight batch mode, it lays the foundation for real-time extensions. The system contributes to the development of AI-enhanced remote sensing in mining by demonstrating a scalable and field-validated geospatial data workflow that supports situational awareness and infrastructure safety.

<title>The Price of Freedom: Exploring Expressivity and Runtime Tradeoffs in Equivariant Tensor Products</title>

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking.

<title>Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion Framework Based on Conditional Latent Generative Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently, diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover, application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset, ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics (presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

<title>A Production Scheduling Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Real-World Constraints</title>

Abstract: The classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) focuses on optimizing makespan under deterministic constraints. Real-world production environments introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP formulations by incorporating key \mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches, providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and uncertain conditions. We release JobShopLab as an open-source tool for both research and industrial applications, accessible at: https://github.com/proto-lab-ro/jobshoplab

<title>Flexible-length Text Infilling for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often exhibit learning behaviors that are not intuitively interpretable by human observers, which can result in suboptimal feedback in collaborative teaching settings. Yet, how humans perceive and interpret RL agent's learning behavior is largely unknown. In a bottom-up approach with two experiments, this work provides a data-driven understanding of the factors of human observers' understanding of the agent's learning process. A novel, observation-based paradigm to directly assess human inferences about agent learning was developed. In an exploratory interview study (\textit{N}=9), we identify four core themes in human interpretations: Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms. A second confirmatory study (\textit{N}=34) applied an expanded version of the paradigm across two tasks (navigation/manipulation) and two RL algorithms (tabular/function approximation). Analyses of 816 responses confirmed the reliability of the paradigm and refined the thematic framework, revealing how these themes evolve over time and interrelate. Our findings provide a human-centered understanding of how people make sense of agent learning, offering actionable insights for designing interpretable RL systems and improving transparency in Human-Robot Interaction.

Abstract: Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered \textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation (\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS} comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT, TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO. Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information. Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human mobility simulation.

Abstract: Despite federated learning (FL)'s potential in collaborative learning, its performance has deteriorated due to the data heterogeneity of distributed users. Recently, clustered federated learning (CFL) has emerged to address this challenge by partitioning users into clusters according to their similarity. However, CFL faces difficulties in training when users are unwilling to share their cluster identities due to privacy concerns. To address these issues, we present an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL, dubbed EBS-CFL. The proposed EBS-CFL supports effectively training CFL while maintaining users' cluster identity confidentially. Moreover, it detects potential poisonous attacks without compromising individual client gradients by discarding negatively correlated gradients and aggregating positively correlated ones using a weighted approach. The server also authenticates correct gradient encoding by clients. EBS-CFL has high efficiency with client-side overhead O(ml + m^2) for communication and O(m^2l) for computation, where m is the number of cluster identities, and l is the gradient size. When m = 1, EBS-CFL's computational efficiency of client is at least O(log n) times better than comparison schemes, where n is the number of clients.In addition, we validate the scheme through extensive experiments. Finally, we theoretically prove the scheme's security.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by mitigating privacy concerns and enabling large-scale patient data analysis. This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA). Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical research, device testing, and computational modeling.

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e., in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data, which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark, Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources. Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time coverage from few hours to a week.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a experience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven learning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However, as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2) We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial. (3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more researchers to join this important research direction.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our construction process to guide future users when constructing their own context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.

<title>Meta-learning how to Share Credit among Macro-Actions</title>

Abstract: One proposed mechanism to improve exploration in reinforcement learning is through the use of macro-actions. Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment. Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration, therefore making learning more effective.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now capable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical conditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience negative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the model can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's negative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a more reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address this issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and emotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset, generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their concerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models with various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences with both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to patients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental results demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's ability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original capability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.

<title>Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning</title>

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.

<title>TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

<title>Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning As Neural Manifold Packing</title>

Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs. While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' -- which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification). Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models, highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.

Abstract: Distributed computing systems are essential for meeting the demands of modern applications, yet transitioning from single-system to distributed environments presents significant challenges. Misallocating resources in shared systems can lead to resource contention, system instability, degraded performance, priority inversion, inefficient utilization, increased latency, and environmental impact.
  We present BanditWare, an online recommendation system that dynamically selects the most suitable hardware for applications using a contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm. BanditWare balances exploration and exploitation, gradually refining its hardware recommendations based on observed application performance while continuing to explore potentially better options. Unlike traditional statistical and machine learning approaches that rely heavily on large historical datasets, BanditWare operates online, learning and adapting in real-time as new workloads arrive.
  We evaluated BanditWare on three workflow applications: Cycles (an agricultural science scientific workflow) BurnPro3D (a web-based platform for fire science) and a matrix multiplication application. Designed for seamless integration with the National Data Platform (NDP), BanditWare enables users of all experience levels to optimize resource allocation efficiently.

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability</title>

Abstract: Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

Abstract: Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains. Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at: https://github.com/UMass-Embodied-AGI/BudgetGuidance.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning, while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling. Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models, and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper leverages various philosophical and ontological frameworks to explore the concept of embodied artificial general intelligence (AGI), its relationship to human consciousness, and the key role of the metaverse in facilitating this relationship. Several theoretical frameworks underpin this exploration, such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a "Self," and Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, which lead to considering human perceived outer reality as a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and where AGI could embody a different form of consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the necessary architecture for the emergence of an embodied AGI, how to calibrate an AGI's symbolic interface, and the key role played by the Metaverse, decentralized systems and open-source blockchain technology. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI.

Abstract: The burgeoning integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human society brings forth significant implications for societal governance and safety. While considerable strides have been made in addressing AI alignment challenges, existing methodologies primarily focus on technical facets, often neglecting the intricate sociotechnical nature of AI systems, which can lead to a misalignment between the development and deployment contexts. To this end, we posit a new problem worth exploring: Incentive Compatibility Sociotechnical Alignment Problem (ICSAP). We hope this can call for more researchers to explore how to leverage the principles of Incentive Compatibility (IC) from game theory to bridge the gap between technical and societal components to maintain AI consensus with human societies in different contexts. We further discuss three classical game problems for achieving IC: mechanism design, contract theory, and Bayesian persuasion, in addressing the perspectives, potentials, and challenges of solving ICSAP, and provide preliminary implementation conceptions.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce the safety human preference dataset, PKU-SafeRLHF, designed to promote research on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs). As a sibling project to SafeRLHF and BeaverTails, we separate annotations of helpfulness and harmlessness for question-answering pairs, providing distinct perspectives on these coupled attributes. Overall, we provide 44.6k refined prompts and 265k question-answer pairs with safety meta-labels for 19 harm categories and three severity levels ranging from minor to severe, with answers generated by Llama-family models. Based on this, we collected 166.8k preference data, including dual-preference (helpfulness and harmlessness decoupled) and single-preference data (trade-off the helpfulness and harmlessness from scratch), respectively. Using the large-scale annotation data, we further train severity-sensitive moderation for the risk control of LLMs and safety-centric RLHF algorithms for the safety alignment of LLMs. We believe this dataset will be a valuable resource for the community, aiding in the safe deployment of LLMs. Data is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF.

Abstract: Is there a way to design powerful AI systems based on machine learning methods that would satisfy probabilistic safety guarantees? With the long-term goal of obtaining a probabilistic guarantee that would apply in every context, we consider estimating a context-dependent bound on the probability of violating a given safety specification. Such a risk evaluation would need to be performed at run-time to provide a guardrail against dangerous actions of an AI. Noting that different plausible hypotheses about the world could produce very different outcomes, and because we do not know which one is right, we derive bounds on the safety violation probability predicted under the true but unknown hypothesis. Such bounds could be used to reject potentially dangerous actions. Our main results involve searching for cautious but plausible hypotheses, obtained by a maximization that involves Bayesian posteriors over hypotheses. We consider two forms of this result, in the i.i.d. case and in the non-i.i.d. case, and conclude with open problems towards turning such theoretical results into practical AI guardrails.

Abstract: Urban forecasting has increasingly benefited from high-dimensional spatial data through two primary approaches: graph-based methods that rely on predefined spatial structures, and region-based methods that focus on learning expressive urban representations. Although these methods have laid a strong foundation, they either rely heavily on structured spatial data, struggle to adapt to task-specific dependencies, or fail to integrate holistic urban context. Moreover, no existing framework systematically integrates these two paradigms and overcomes their respective limitations. To address this gap, we propose a novel, unified framework for high-dimensional urban forecasting, composed of three key components: (1) the Urban Region Representation Module that organizes latent embeddings and semantic descriptions for each region, (2) the Task-aware Dependency Retrieval module that selects relevant context regions based on natural language prompts, and (3) the Prediction Module, exemplified by our proposed GeoTransformer architecture, which adopts a novel geospatial attention mechanism to incorporate spatial proximity and information entropy as priors. Our framework is modular, supports diverse representation methods and forecasting models, and can operate even with minimal input. Quantitative experiments and qualitative analysis across six urban forecasting tasks demonstrate strong task generalization and validate the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: The reasoning steps generated by LLMs might be incomplete, as they mimic logical leaps common in everyday communication found in their pre-training data: underlying rationales are frequently left implicit (unstated). To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SEED-Attack.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with data-analytics requests related to information retrieval and data manipulation that frequently arise in real-world scenarios under multiple conditions. In this paper, we introduce Thinking with Tables, where we inject tabular structures into LLMs for data-analytics requests. Through comprehensive evaluations across various request types, we show that providing tabular structures yields a 40.29 percent average performance gain along with better robustness and token efficiency. Through attention-value analysis, we uncover that tables help LLMs better attend to relevant information, explaining these improvements. Beyond tables and text, we evaluate whether (1) blending structuredness within text, such as providing templates or fixing the order of attributes, and (2) other representative structures, such as knowledge graphs and JSON, are helpful. We observe that utilizing tables offers the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness. These advantages remain consistent under increased task complexity and even when all input data cannot be structured. Finally, as data analytics typically relies on structured factual inputs, our text-to-table conversion demonstrates the method's applicability to text-compatible data sources.

Abstract: Quantitative information flow analyses (QIF) are a class of techniques for measuring the amount of confidential information leaked by a program to its public outputs. Shannon entropy is an important method to quantify the amount of leakage in QIF. This paper focuses on the programs modeled in Boolean constraints and optimizes the two stages of the Shannon entropy computation to implement a scalable precise tool PSE. In the first stage, we design a knowledge compilation language called \ADDAND that combines Algebraic Decision Diagrams and conjunctive decomposition. \ADDAND avoids enumerating possible outputs of a program and supports tractable entropy computation. In the second stage, we optimize the model counting queries that are used to compute the probabilities of outputs. We compare PSE with the state-of-the-art probabilistic approximately correct tool EntropyEstimation, which was shown to significantly outperform the previous precise tools. The experimental results demonstrate that PSE solved 56 more benchmarks compared to EntropyEstimation in a total of 459. For 98\% of the benchmarks that both PSE and EntropyEstimation solved, PSE is at least $10\times$ as efficient as EntropyEstimation.

Abstract: Artificial computing machinery transforms representations through an objective process, to be interpreted subjectively by humans, so the machine and the interpreter are different entities, but in the putative natural computing both processes are performed by the same agent. The method or process that transforms a representation is called here the mode of computing. The mode used by digital computers is the algorithmic one, but there are others, such as quantum computers and diverse forms of non-conventional computing, and there is an open-ended set of representational formats and modes that could be used in artificial and natural computing. A mode based on a notion of computing different from Turing's may perform feats beyond what the Turing Machine does but the modes would not be of the same kind and could not be compared. For a mode of computing to be more powerful than the algorithmic one, it ought to compute functions lacking an effective algorithm, and Church Thesis would not hold. Here, a thought experiment including a computational demon using a hypothetical mode for such an effect is presented. If there is natural computing, there is a mode of natural computing whose properties may be causal to the phenomenological experience. Discovering it would come with solving the hard problem of consciousness; but if it turns out that such a mode does not exist, there is no such thing as natural computing, and the mind is not a computational process.

<title>From System 1 to System 2: A Survey of Reasoning Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Proprietary corporate documents contain rich domain-specific knowledge, but their overwhelming volume and disorganized structure make it difficult even for employees to access the right information when needed. For example, in the automotive industry, vehicle crash-collision tests, each costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, produce highly detailed documentation. However, retrieving relevant content during decision-making remains time-consuming due to the scale and complexity of the material. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question Answering (QA) systems offer a promising solution, building an internal RAG-QA system poses several challenges: (1) handling heterogeneous multi-modal data sources, (2) preserving data confidentiality, and (3) enabling traceability between each piece of information in the generated answer and its original source document. To address these, we propose a RAG-QA framework for internal enterprise use, consisting of: (1) a data pipeline that converts raw multi-modal documents into a structured corpus and QA pairs, (2) a fully on-premise, privacy-preserving architecture, and (3) a lightweight reference matcher that links answer segments to supporting content. Applied to the automotive domain, our system improves factual correctness (+1.79, +1.94), informativeness (+1.33, +1.16), and helpfulness (+1.08, +1.67) over a non-RAG baseline, based on 1-5 scale ratings from both human and LLM judge.

Abstract: We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.

Abstract: Regardless of past learning, an agent in an open world will face unfamiliar events outside of prior experience, existing models, or policies. Further, the agent will sometimes lack relevant knowledge and/or sufficient time to assess the situation and evaluate response options. How can an agent respond reasonably to situations that are outside of its original design scope? How can it recognize such situations sufficiently quickly and reliably to determine reasonable, adaptive courses of action? We identify key characteristics needed for solutions, review the state-of-the-art, and outline a proposed, novel approach that combines domain-general meta-knowledge (inspired by human cognition) and metareasoning. This approach offers potential for fast, adaptive responses to unfamiliar situations, more fully meeting the performance characteristics required for open-world, general agents.

Abstract: One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even different research traditions have somewhat independently identified similar/common patterns of processes and representations or "cognitive design patterns" that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of mechanisms and representations available for exploring the possibilities of general intelligence. This paper outlines a few recurring cognitive design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures. We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs, especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. Examining and applying these recurring patterns enables predictions of gaps or deficiencies in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identification of subjects of future research towards general intelligence using generative foundation models.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

Abstract: To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter information, and make informed decisions in ever-changing situations is critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios.
  To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized, tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures. We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms, memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities, and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC) aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments, emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to hypothetical or non existent entities.

Abstract: An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure. In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for swap regret, and thus, along the way, imply convergence to a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of weighted regret minimization, with unknown weights determined by the path length of the agents' policy sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.

Abstract: We extend conformal prediction to control the expected value of any monotone loss function. The algorithm generalizes split conformal prediction together with its coverage guarantee. Like conformal prediction, the conformal risk control procedure is tight up to an $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ factor. We also introduce extensions of the idea to distribution shift, quantile risk control, multiple and adversarial risk control, and expectations of U-statistics. Worked examples from computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the usage of our algorithm to bound the false negative rate, graph distance, and token-level F1-score.

Abstract: By contextualizing the kernel as global as possible, Modern ConvNets have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural network architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.

Abstract: Vector databases (VDBs) have emerged to manage high-dimensional data that exceed the capabilities of traditional database management systems, and are now tightly integrated with large language models as well as widely applied in modern artificial intelligence systems. Although relatively few studies describe existing or introduce new vector database architectures, the core technologies underlying VDBs, such as approximate nearest neighbor search, have been extensively studied and are well documented in the literature. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of the relevant algorithms to provide a general understanding of this booming research area. Specifically, we first provide a review of storage and retrieval techniques in VDBs, with detailed design principles and technological evolution. Then, we conduct an in-depth comparison of several advanced VDB solutions with their strengths, limitations, and typical application scenarios. Finally, we also outline emerging opportunities for coupling VDBs with large language models, including open research problems and trends, such as novel indexing strategies. This survey aims to serve as a practical resource, enabling readers to quickly gain an overall understanding of the current knowledge landscape in this rapidly developing area.

Abstract: Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.

Abstract: Contrastive pretraining is well-known to improve downstream task performance and model generalisation, especially in limited label settings. However, it is sensitive to the choice of augmentation pipeline. Positive pairs should preserve semantic information while destroying domain-specific information. Standard augmentation pipelines emulate domain-specific changes with pre-defined photometric transformations, but what if we could simulate realistic domain changes instead? In this work, we show how to utilise recent progress in counterfactual image generation to this effect. We propose CF-SimCLR, a counterfactual contrastive learning approach which leverages approximate counterfactual inference for positive pair creation. Comprehensive evaluation across five datasets, on chest radiography and mammography, demonstrates that CF-SimCLR substantially improves robustness to acquisition shift with higher downstream performance on both in- and out-of-distribution data, particularly for domains which are under-represented during training.

Abstract: Traffic prediction has long been a focal and pivotal area in research, witnessing both significant strides from city-level to road-level predictions in recent years. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. In this paper, we present the first systematic classification framework for lane-level traffic prediction, offering a structured taxonomy and analysis of existing methods. We construct three representative datasets from two real-world road networks, covering both regular and irregular lane configurations, and make them publicly available to support future research. We further establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction task formulation, and proposes a simple yet effective baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. This unified framework enables consistent evaluation across datasets and modeling paradigms. We also reproduce previously unavailable code from existing studies and conduct extensive experiments to assess a range of models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and applicability, providing the first benchmark that jointly considers predictive performance and training cost for lane-level traffic scenarios. All datasets and code are released at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/LaneLevel-Traffic-Benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven profound transformations in wireless networks. However, within wireless environments, the training of LLMs faces significant challenges related to security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL), with its decentralized architecture, offers enhanced data privacy protection. Nevertheless, when integrated with LLMs, FL still struggles with several critical limitations, including large-scale and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and substantial communication overhead. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a systematic analysis of the distinct training stages of LLMs in wireless networks, including pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Personalized Wireless Federated Fine-tuning (PWFF) framework. Initially, we utilize the adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to decrease energy consumption, while employing global partial aggregation to reduce communication delay. Subsequently, we develop two reward models and design a personalized loss function to fulfill the goal of personalized learning. Furthermore, we implement a local multi-objective alignment to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the FL process. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to validate the performance of the proposed PWFF method and provide an in-depth discussion of the open issues.

arXiv:2405.11331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to jointly optimize wireless network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and 2. enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, we develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develops policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.

Abstract: Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove the consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization this method may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.

<title>Does learning the right latent variables necessarily improve in-context learning?</title>

Abstract: Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for efficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the data factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates the data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this factorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers implicitly do so or if they instead exploit heuristics and statistical shortcuts enabled by attention layers. Both scenarios have inspired active ongoing work. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of explicitly inferring task latents. We minimally modify the Transformer architecture with a bottleneck designed to prevent shortcuts in favor of more structured solutions, and then compare performance against standard Transformers across various ICL tasks. Contrary to intuition and some recent works, we find little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards task-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution performance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck effectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream processing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study highlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured ICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents aids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.

<title>DP-IQA: Utilizing Diffusion Prior for Blind Image Quality Assessment in the Wild</title>

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (IQA) in the wild, which assesses the quality of images with complex authentic distortions and no reference images, presents significant challenges. Given the difficulty in collecting large-scale training data, leveraging limited data to develop a model with strong generalization remains an open problem. Motivated by the robust image perception capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, we propose a novel IQA method, diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), to utilize the T2I model's prior for improved performance and generalization ability. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained Stable Diffusion as the backbone, extracting multi-level features from the denoising U-Net guided by prompt embeddings through a tunable text adapter. Simultaneously, an image adapter compensates for information loss introduced by the lossy pre-trained encoder. Unlike T2I models that require full image distribution modeling, our approach targets image quality assessment, which inherently requires fewer parameters. To improve applicability, we distill the knowledge into a lightweight CNN-based student model, significantly reducing parameters while maintaining or even enhancing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on various in-the-wild datasets, highlighting the superior generalization capability of T2I priors in blind IQA tasks. To our knowledge, DP-IQA is the first method to apply pre-trained diffusion priors in blind IQA. Codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/RomGai/DP-IQA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to prevent malicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmful content generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect of over-refusal, where LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become less helpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, a systematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting prompts that can elicit the over-refusal behaviors of LLMs. This study proposes a novel method for automatically generating large-scale over-refusal datasets. Leveraging this technique, we introduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Bench comprises 80,000 over-refusal prompts across 10 common rejection categories, a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even for state-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to prevent indiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure the over-refusal of 32 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our datasets are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/bench-llms and our codebase is open-sourced at https://github.com/justincui03/or-bench. We hope this benchmark can help the community develop better safety aligned models.

Abstract: This study addresses ethical issues surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) within the field of artificial intelligence. It explores the common ethical challenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and fairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It highlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and decoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from those encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to tackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance transparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information dissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM ethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical frameworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to diverse contexts. This roadmap aims to guide responsible development and integration of LLMs, envisioning a future where ethical considerations govern AI advancements in society.

Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal for developing new medical treatments but typically carry risks such as patient mortality and enrollment failure that waste immense efforts spanning over a decade. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to predict key events in clinical trials holds great potential for providing insights to guide trial designs. However, complex data collection and question definition requiring medical expertise have hindered the involvement of AI thus far. This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a comprehensive suite of 23 meticulously curated AI-ready datasets covering multi-modal input features and 8 crucial prediction challenges in clinical trial design, encompassing prediction of trial duration, patient dropout rate, serious adverse event, mortality rate, trial approval outcome, trial failure reason, drug dose finding, design of eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide basic validation methods for each task to ensure the datasets' usability and reliability. We anticipate that the availability of such open-access datasets will catalyze the development of advanced AI approaches for clinical trial design, ultimately advancing clinical trial research and accelerating medical solution development.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are flourishing and has advanced many video-language tasks. As a golden testbed, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a timely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming to elucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards more human-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate that Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and generate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However, models falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporal content ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, the models behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video perturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers and questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings demonstrate Video-LLMs' QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their severe deficiency in robustness and interpretability, suggesting the urgent need on rationales in Video-LLM developing.

Abstract: Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries (i.e., Text-to-SQL, a.k.a. NL2SQL) can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of Text-to-SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of Text-to-SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: Text-to-SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to Text-to-SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating Text-to-SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing Text-to-SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding Text-to-SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we offer a rule of thumb for developing Text-to-SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of Text-to-SQL in the LLMs era.

Abstract: Current research in LLM-based simulation systems lacks comprehensive solutions for modeling real-world court proceedings, while existing legal language models struggle with dynamic courtroom interactions. We present AgentCourt, a comprehensive legal simulation framework that addresses these challenges through adversarial evolution of LLM-based agents. Our AgentCourt introduces a new adversarial evolutionary approach for agents called AdvEvol, which performs dynamic knowledge learning and evolution through structured adversarial interactions in a simulated courtroom program, breaking the limitations of the traditional reliance on static knowledge bases or manual annotations. By simulating 1,000 civil cases, we construct an evolving knowledge base that enhances the agents' legal reasoning abilities. The evolved lawyer agents demonstrated outstanding performance on our newly introduced CourtBench benchmark, achieving a 12.1% improvement in performance compared to the original lawyer agents. Evaluations by professional lawyers confirm the effectiveness of our approach across three critical dimensions: cognitive agility, professional knowledge, and logical rigor. Beyond outperforming specialized legal models in interactive reasoning tasks, our findings emphasize the importance of adversarial learning in legal AI and suggest promising directions for extending simulation-based legal reasoning to broader judicial and regulatory contexts.

<title>Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their low-power binary spikes, to bearing fault diagnosis, bridging the gap between high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industrial scenarios. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT, JNU, Bearing, and Gearbox benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption, and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Writing clinical notes and documenting medical exams is a critical task for healthcare professionals, serving as a vital component of patient care documentation. However, manually writing these notes is time-consuming and can impact the amount of time clinicians can spend on direct patient interaction and other tasks. Consequently, the development of automated clinical note generation systems has emerged as a clinically meaningful area of research within AI for health. In this paper, we present three key contributions to the field of clinical note generation using large language models (LLMs). First, we introduce CliniKnote, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 1,200 complex doctor-patient conversations paired with their full clinical notes. This dataset, created and curated by medical experts with the help of modern neural networks, provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating models in clinical note generation tasks. Second, we propose the K-SOAP (Keyword, Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) note format, which enhances traditional SOAP~\cite{podder2023soap} (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes by adding a keyword section at the top, allowing for quick identification of essential information. Third, we develop an automatic pipeline to generate K-SOAP notes from doctor-patient conversations and benchmark various modern LLMs using various metrics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and performance compared to standard LLM finetuning methods.

Abstract: A vishing attack is a form of social engineering where attackers use phone calls to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information, such as personal data, financial information, or security credentials. Attackers exploit the perceived urgency and authenticity of voice communication to manipulate victims, often posing as legitimate entities like banks or tech support. Vishing is a particularly serious threat as it bypasses security controls designed to protect information. In this work, we study the potential for vishing attacks to escalate with the advent of AI. In theory, AI-powered software bots may have the ability to automate these attacks by initiating conversations with potential victims via phone calls and deceiving them into disclosing sensitive information. To validate this thesis, we introduce ViKing, an AI-powered vishing system developed using publicly available AI technology. It relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core cognitive processor to steer conversations with victims, complemented by a pipeline of speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules that facilitate audio-text conversion in phone calls. Through a controlled social experiment involving 240 participants, we discovered that ViKing has successfully persuaded many participants to reveal sensitive information, even those who had been explicitly warned about the risk of vishing campaigns. Interactions with ViKing's bots were generally considered realistic. From these findings, we conclude that tools like ViKing may already be accessible to potential malicious actors, while also serving as an invaluable resource for cyber awareness programs.

Abstract: The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). If model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. Continual pre-training of OLMo-7B corroborates these results. Next, we study the impact of the weight decay parameter on example forgetting, showing that empirical forgetting occurs faster than the cumulative weight decay. This allows us to gauge the degree of example forgetting in large-scale training runs, indicating that many LLMs, including Lllama 3 405B, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. We propose a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, we find that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, we show that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, we upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. Our results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models. Code is available.

Abstract: Deep learning and advancements in contactless sensors have significantly enhanced our ability to understand complex human activities in healthcare settings. In particular, deep learning models utilizing computer vision have been developed to enable detailed analysis of human gesture recognition, especially repetitive gestures which are commonly observed behaviors in children with autism. This research work aims to identify repetitive behaviors indicative of autism by analyzing videos captured in natural settings as children engage in daily activities. The focus is on accurately categorizing real-time repetitive gestures such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping. To this end, we utilize the publicly accessible Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) to classify these stereotypical movements. A key component of the proposed methodology is the use of \textbf{VideoMAE}, a model designed to improve both spatial and temporal analysis of video data through a masking and reconstruction mechanism. This model significantly outperformed traditional methods, achieving an accuracy of 97.7\%, a 14.7\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

<title>Compositional Shielding and Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining high-performance policies. However, the safety of these policies has been a long-standing issue. One promising paradigm to guarantee safety is a shield, which shields a policy from making unsafe actions. However, computing a shield scales exponentially in the number of state variables. This is a particular concern in multi-agent systems with many agents. In this work, we propose a novel approach for multi-agent shielding. We address scalability by computing individual shields for each agent. The challenge is that typical safety specifications are global properties, but the shields of individual agents only ensure local properties. Our key to overcome this challenge is to apply assume-guarantee reasoning. Specifically, we present a sound proof rule that decomposes a (global, complex) safety specification into (local, simple) obligations for the shields of the individual agents. Moreover, we show that applying the shields during reinforcement learning significantly improves the quality of the policies obtained for a given training budget. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our multi-agent shielding framework in two case studies, reducing the computation time from hours to seconds and achieving fast learning convergence.

Abstract: Reliable estimation of predictive uncertainty is crucial for machine learning applications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where hedging against risks is essential. Despite its significance, there is no universal agreement on how to best quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we revisit core concepts to propose a framework for information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty. Our proposed framework categorizes predictive uncertainty measures according to two factors: (I) The predicting model (II) The approximation of the true predictive distribution. Examining all possible combinations of these two factors, we derive a set of predictive uncertainty measures that includes both known and newly introduced ones. We extensively evaluate these measures across a broad set of tasks, identifying conditions under which certain measures excel. Our findings show the importance of aligning the choice of uncertainty measure with the predicting model on in-distribution (ID) data, the limitations of epistemic uncertainty measures for out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and that the disentanglement between measures varies substantially between ID and OOD data. Together, these insights provide a more comprehensive understanding of predictive uncertainty measures, revealing their implicit assumptions and relationships.

<title>MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention</title>

arXiv:2410.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

Abstract: Question answering on free-form tables (a.k.a. TableQA) is a challenging task because of the flexible structure and complex schema of tables. Recent studies use Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, exploiting their capability in understanding the questions and tabular data, which are typically given in natural language and contain many textual fields, respectively. While this approach has shown promising results, it overlooks the challenges brought by numerical values which are common in tabular data, and LLMs are known to struggle with such values. We aim to address this issue, and we propose a model named TabLaP that uses LLMs as a planner rather than an answer generator. This approach exploits LLMs' capability in multi-step reasoning while leaving the actual numerical calculations to a Python interpreter for accurate calculation. Recognizing the inaccurate nature of LLMs, we further make a first attempt to quantify the trustworthiness of the answers produced by TabLaP, such that users can use TabLaP in a regret-aware manner. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that TabLaP is substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art models, improving the answer accuracy by 5.7% and 5.8% on the two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress on image-to-video (I2V) generation, while their noise-to-data generation process is inherently mismatched with this task, which may lead to suboptimal synthesis quality. In this work, we present FrameBridge. By modeling the frame-to-frames generation process with a bridge model based data-to-data generative process, we are able to fully exploit the information contained in the given image and improve the consistency between the generation process and I2V task. Moreover, we propose two novel techniques toward the two popular settings of training I2V models, respectively. Firstly, we propose SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF), making the first attempt to fine-tune a diffusion model to a bridge model and, therefore, allowing us to utilize the pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models. Secondly, we propose neural prior, further improving the synthesis quality of FrameBridge when training from scratch. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate the superior quality of FrameBridge in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 95 vs. 192 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101), and the advantages of our proposed SAF and neural prior for bridge-based I2V models.

Abstract: Behavioral diversity, expert imitation, fairness, safety goals and others give rise to preferences in sequential decision making domains that do not decompose additively across time. We introduce the class of convex Markov games that allow general convex preferences over occupancy measures. Despite infinite time horizon and strictly higher generality than Markov games, pure strategy Nash equilibria exist. Furthermore, equilibria can be approximated empirically by performing gradient descent on an upper bound of exploitability. Our experiments reveal novel solutions to classic repeated normal-form games, find fair solutions in a repeated asymmetric coordination game, and prioritize safe long-term behavior in a robot warehouse environment. In the prisoner's dilemma, our algorithm leverages transient imitation to find a policy profile that deviates from observed human play only slightly, yet achieves higher per-player utility while also being three orders of magnitude less exploitable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.

Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.

Abstract: Humans excel at learning abstract patterns across different sequences, filtering out irrelevant details, and transferring these generalized concepts to new sequences. In contrast, many sequence learning models lack the ability to abstract, which leads to memory inefficiency and poor transfer. We introduce a non-parametric hierarchical variable learning model (HVM) that learns chunks from sequences and abstracts contextually similar chunks as variables. HVM efficiently organizes memory while uncovering abstractions, leading to compact sequence representations. When learning on language datasets such as babyLM, HVM learns a more efficient dictionary than standard compression algorithms such as Lempel-Ziv. In a sequence recall task requiring the acquisition and transfer of variables embedded in sequences, we demonstrate HVM's sequence likelihood correlates with human recall times. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) struggle to transfer abstract variables as effectively as humans. From HVM's adjustable layer of abstraction, we demonstrate that the model realizes a precise trade-off between compression and generalization. Our work offers a cognitive model that captures the learning and transfer of abstract representations in human cognition and differentiates itself from LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for improving large language and multimodal model performance. However, it is still an open question under which settings CoT systematically reduces performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, focusing on six representative tasks from the psychological literature where deliberation hurts performance in humans. In three of these tasks, state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance drop-offs with CoT (up to 36.3\% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o), while in others, CoT effects are mixed, with positive, neutral, and negative changes. While models and humans do not exhibit perfectly parallel cognitive processes, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for humans helps identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human verbal thinking and deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a perspective for understanding the impact of inference-time reasoning.

Abstract: Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of natural-language questions in the decision theory of so-called Newcomb-like problems. Newcomb-like problems include, for instance, decision problems in which an agent interacts with a similar other agent, and thus has to reason about the fact that the other agent will likely reason in similar ways. Evaluating LLM reasoning about Newcomb-like problems is important because interactions between foundation-model-based agents will often be Newcomb-like. Some ways of reasoning about Newcomb-like problems may allow for greater cooperation between models.
  Our dataset contains both capabilities questions (i.e., questions with a unique, uncontroversially correct answer) and attitude questions (i.e., questions about which decision theorists would disagree). We use our dataset for an investigation of decision-theoretical capabilities and expressed attitudes and their interplay in existing models (different models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, GDM, Reka, etc.), as well as models under simple prompt-based interventions. We find, among other things, that attitudes vary significantly between existing models; that high capabilities are associated with attitudes more favorable toward so-called evidential decision theory; and that attitudes are consistent across different types of questions.

Abstract: Efficiently processing and interpreting network data is critical for the operation of increasingly complex networks. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have improved data processing in network management. However, existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG struggle with the complexity and implicit nature of semi-structured technical data, leading to inefficiencies in time, cost, and retrieval. This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data. FastRAG employs schema learning and script learning to extract and structure data without needing to submit entire data sources to an LLM. It integrates text search with knowledge graph (KG) querying to improve accuracy in retrieving context-rich information. Evaluation results demonstrate that FastRAG provides accurate question answering, while improving up to 90% in time and 85% in cost compared to GraphRAG.

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer severe object repetition and local distortion when the inference resolution differs from its pre-trained resolution. We propose AccDiffusion v2, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation without training. Our in-depth analysis in this paper shows that using an identical text prompt for different patches leads to repetitive generation, while the absence of a prompt undermines image details. In response, our AccDiffusion v2 novelly decouples the vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of a patch. Further analysis reveals that local distortion arises from inaccurate descriptions in prompts about the local structure of higher-resolution images. To address this issue, AccDiffusion v2, for the first time, introduces an auxiliary local structural information through ControlNet during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation aiming to mitigate the local distortions. Finally, our analysis indicates that global semantic information is conducive to suppressing both repetitive generation and local distortion. Hence, our AccDiffusion v2 further proposes dilated sampling with window interaction for better global semantic information during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation. We conduct extensive experiments, including both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, to demonstrate the efficacy of our AccDiffusion v2. The quantitative comparison shows that AccDiffusion v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation extrapolation without training. The qualitative comparison intuitively illustrates that AccDiffusion v2 effectively suppresses the issues of repetitive generation and local distortion in image generation extrapolation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.

<title>Achieving Collective Welfare in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Suggestion Sharing</title>

Abstract: In human society, the conflict between self-interest and collective well-being often obstructs efforts to achieve shared welfare. Related concepts like the Tragedy of the Commons and Social Dilemmas frequently manifest in our daily lives. As artificial agents increasingly serve as autonomous proxies for humans, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method to address this issue - learning policies to maximise collective returns even when individual agents' interests conflict with the collective one. Unlike traditional cooperative MARL solutions that involve sharing rewards, values, and policies or designing intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to learn collectively optimal policies, we propose a novel MARL approach where agents exchange action suggestions. Our method reveals less private information compared to sharing rewards, values, or policies, while enabling effective cooperation without the need to design intrinsic rewards. Our algorithm is supported by our theoretical analysis that establishes a bound on the discrepancy between collective and individual objectives, demonstrating how sharing suggestions can align agents' behaviours with the collective objective. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs competitively with baselines that rely on value or policy sharing or intrinsic rewards.

<title>AnalogXpert: Automating Analog Topology Synthesis by Incorporating Circuit Design Expertise into Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Analog circuits are crucial in modern electronic systems, and automating their design has attracted significant research interest. One of major challenges is topology synthesis, which determines circuit components and their connections. Recent studies explore large language models (LLM) for topology synthesis. However, the scenarios addressed by these studies do not align well with practical applications. Specifically, existing work uses vague design requirements as input and outputs an ideal model, but detailed structural requirements and device-level models are more practical. Moreover, current approaches either formulate topology synthesis as graph generation or Python code generation, whereas practical topology design is a complex process that demands extensive design knowledge. In this work, we propose AnalogXpert, a LLM-based agent aiming at solving practical topology synthesis problem by incorporating circuit design expertise into LLMs. First, we represent analog topology as SPICE code and introduce a subcircuit library to reduce the design space, in the same manner as experienced designers. Second, we decompose the problem into two sub-task (i.e., block selection and block connection) through the use of CoT and incontext learning techniques, to mimic the practical design process. Third, we introduce a proofreading strategy that allows LLMs to incrementally correct the errors in the initial design, akin to human designers who iteratively check and adjust the initial topology design to ensure accuracy. Finally, we construct a high-quality benchmark containing both real data (30) and synthetic data (2k). AnalogXpert achieves 40% and 23% success rates on the synthetic dataset and real dataset respectively, which is markedly better than those of GPT-4o (3% on both the synthetic dataset and the real dataset).

Abstract: Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Multimodal learning with incomplete modality is practical and challenging. Recently, researchers have focused on enhancing the robustness of pre-trained MultiModal Transformers (MMTs) under missing modality conditions by applying learnable prompts. However, these prompt-based methods face several limitations: (1) incomplete modalities provide restricted modal cues for task-specific inference, (2) dummy imputation for missing content causes information loss and introduces noise, and (3) static prompts are instance-agnostic, offering limited knowledge for instances with various missing conditions. To address these issues, we propose RAGPT, a novel Retrieval-AuGmented dynamic Prompt Tuning framework. RAGPT comprises three modules: (I) the multi-channel retriever, which identifies similar instances through a within-modality retrieval strategy, (II) the missing modality generator, which recovers missing information using retrieved contexts, and (III) the context-aware prompter, which captures contextual knowledge from relevant instances and generates dynamic prompts to largely enhance the MMT's robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that RAGPT consistently outperforms all competitive baselines in handling incomplete modality problems. The code of our work and prompt-based baselines is available at https://github.com/Jian-Lang/RAGPT.

<title>An Investigation into Value Misalignment in LLM-Generated Texts for Cultural Heritage</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in tasks related to cultural heritage, such as generating descriptions of historical monuments, translating ancient texts, preserving oral traditions, and creating educational content, their ability to produce accurate and culturally aligned texts is being increasingly relied upon by users and researchers. However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts. Using both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze the cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are concerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment with key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a valuable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural sensitivity and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Self-attention relies on positional embeddings to encode input order. Relative Position (RelPos) embeddings are widely used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, RelPos has quadratic time complexity to input length and is often incompatible with fast GPU implementations of attention. In contrast, Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) rotates each input vector based on its absolute position, taking linear time to sequence length, implicitly encoding relative distances through self-attention dot products. Thus, it is usually compatible with efficient attention. However, its use in ASR remains underexplored. This work evaluates RoPE across diverse ASR tasks with training data ranging from 100 to 50,000 hours, covering various speech types (read, spontaneous, clean, noisy) and different accents in both streaming and non-streaming settings. ASR error rates are similar or better than RelPos, while training time is reduced by up to 21%. Code is available via the SpeechBrain toolkit.

Abstract: Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.

Abstract: Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection. We open-source the project and our models.

<title>Which Optimizer Works Best for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks?</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.

Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved promising results in solving online 3D Bin Packing Problems (3D-BPP). However, these DRL-based policies may perform poorly on new instances due to distribution shift. Besides generalization, we also consider adaptation, completely overlooked by previous work, which aims at rapidly fine-tuning these policies to a new test distribution. To tackle both generalization and adaptation issues, we propose ASAP, which decomposes a solver's decision-making into two policies, one for proposal and one for selection. The role of the proposal policy is to suggest promising actions, which allows the selection policy to choose among them. To effectively learn these policies, we introduce a training framework that combines pre-training and post-training, enhanced by meta-learning. During online adaptation, we only fine-tune the selection policy to rapidly adapt to a test distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAP exhibits excellent generalization and adaptation capabilities on in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances for both discrete and continuous setups.

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a critical challenge in neural network training, limits a model's ability to adapt to new tasks or shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.

Abstract: Sample inefficiency is a long-lasting challenge in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Despite dramatic improvements have been made, the problem is far from being solved and is especially challenging in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. In our work, we propose to use Adversarial Estimates as a new, simple and efficient approach to mitigate this problem for a class of feedback-based DRL algorithms. Our approach leverages latent similarity search from a small set of human-collected trajectories to boost learning, using only five minutes of human-recorded experience. The results of our study show algorithms trained with Adversarial Estimates converge faster than their original version. Moreover, we discuss how our approach could enable learning in feedback-based algorithms in extreme scenarios with very sparse rewards.

Abstract: From extracting features to generating text, the outputs of large language models (LLMs) typically rely on the final layers, following the conventional wisdom that earlier layers capture only low-level cues. However, our analysis shows that intermediate layers can encode even richer representations, often improving performance on a range of downstream tasks. To explain and quantify these hidden-layer properties, we propose a unified framework of representation quality metrics based on information theory, geometry, and invariance to input perturbations. Our framework highlights how each layer balances information compression and signal preservation, revealing why mid-depth embeddings can exceed the last layer's performance. Through extensive experiments on 32 text-embedding tasks across various architectures (transformers, state-space models) and domains (language, vision), we demonstrate that intermediate layers consistently provide stronger features, challenging the standard view on final-layer embeddings and opening new directions on using mid-layer representations for more robust and accurate representations.

Abstract: Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning (CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs, with up to a 40% increase in benchmark performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models are fully open-sourced.

<title>The Other Side of the Coin: Unveiling the Downsides of Model Aggregation in Federated Learning from a Layer-peeled Perspective</title>

arXiv:2502.03231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often observed that the aggregated model in FL underperforms on local data until after several rounds of local training. This temporary performance drop can potentially slow down the convergence of the FL model. Prior work regards this performance drop as an inherent cost of knowledge sharing among clients and does not give it special attention. While some studies directly focus on designing techniques to alleviate the issue, its root causes remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we construct a framework that enables layer-peeled analysis of how feature representations evolve during model aggregation in FL. It focuses on two key aspects: (1) the intrinsic quality of extracted features, and (2) the alignment between features and their subsequent parameters -- both of which are critical to downstream performance. Using this framework, we first investigate how model aggregation affects internal feature extraction process. Our analysis reveals that aggregation degrades feature quality and weakens the coupling between intermediate features and subsequent layers, both of which are well shaped during local training. More importantly, this degradation is not confined to specific layers but progressively accumulates with network depth -- a phenomenon we term Cumulative Feature Degradation (CFD). CFD significantly impairs the quality of penultimate-layer features and weakens their coupling with the classifier, ultimately degrading model performance. We further revisit several widely adopted solutions through the lens of layer-peeled feature extraction to understand why they are effective in addressing aggregation-induced performance drop. Our results show that their effectiveness lies in mitigating the feature degradation described above, which is well aligned with our observations.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks. The official code is released at https://github.com/research4pan/AdaptPruner.

Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

Abstract: Multi-sample aggregation strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are widely used in contemporary large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive accuracy across various tasks. A key challenge in this process is temperature selection, which significantly impacts model performance. Existing approaches either rely on a fixed default temperature or require labeled validation data for tuning, which are often scarce and difficult to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically identifying the (near)-optimal temperature for different LLMs using multi-sample aggregation strategies, without relying on task-specific validation data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of temperature's role in performance optimization, considering variations in model architectures, datasets, task types, model sizes, and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization, which consistently outperforms fixed-temperature baselines. Additionally, we incorporate a stochastic process model to enhance interpretability, offering deeper insights into the relationship between temperature and model performance.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moir\'e quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate and efficient solution without human bias. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.

Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.

<title>Multi-Knowledge-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Intelligent Systems</title>

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in Intelligent Imaging, facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality and hinder reliable object detection in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-knowledge-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MKoIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MKoIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead to meet the requirements of real-time imaging deployment. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MKoIE surpasses existing methods, enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency of intelligent imaging.

<title>PoGDiff: Product-of-Gaussians Diffusion Models for Imbalanced Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.

<title>Truth Knows No Language: Evaluating Truthfulness Beyond English</title>

Abstract: We introduce a professionally translated extension of the TruthfulQA benchmark designed to evaluate truthfulness in Basque, Catalan, Galician, and Spanish. Truthfulness evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have primarily been conducted in English. However, the ability of LLMs to maintain truthfulness across languages remains under-explored. Our study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs, comparing base and instruction-tuned models using human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque (the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across languages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that LLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than multiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in truthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation provides a viable approach for extending truthfulness benchmarks to additional languages, offering a scalable alternative to professional translation. Finally, we observe that universal knowledge questions are better handled across languages than context- and time-dependent ones, highlighting the need for truthfulness evaluations that account for cultural and temporal variability. Dataset and code are publicly available under open licenses.

<title>SelfCite: Self-Supervised Alignment for Context Attribution in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.09604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

Abstract: We investigate factors contributing to LLM agents' success in competitive multi-agent environments, using auctions as a testbed where agents bid to maximize profit. The agents are equipped with bidding domain knowledge, distinct personas that reflect item preferences, and a memory of auction history. Our work extends the classic auction scenario by creating a realistic environment where multiple agents bid on houses, weighing aspects such as size, location, and budget to secure the most desirable homes at the lowest prices. Particularly, we investigate three key questions: (a) How does a persona influence an agent's behavior in a competitive setting? (b) Can an agent effectively profile its competitors' behavior during auctions? (c) How can persona profiling be leveraged to create an advantage using strategies such as theory of mind? Through a series of experiments, we analyze the behaviors of LLM agents and shed light on new findings. Our testbed, called HARBOR, offers a valuable platform for deepening our understanding of multi-agent workflows in competitive environments.

<title>Boosting Generalization in Diffusion-Based Neural Combinatorial Solver via Inference Time Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2502.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.

<title>ProMedTS: A Self-Supervised, Prompt-Guided Multimodal Approach for Integrating Medical Text and Time Series</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>Quantifying Memorization and Parametric Response Rates in Retrieval-Augmented Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in question answering (QA), but metrics for assessing their reliance on memorization versus retrieval remain underdeveloped. Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. In line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on memorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a result (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical comparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here, we find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are consistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset. As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for differences in model memorization across different modalities and more generally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To further mitigate the noise in different reward models, we propose a Bayesian Aggregation approach that unifies multiple margin sources (external and implicit) into a single preference probability. Extensive experiments in diverse settings demonstrate the consistently high data efficiency of our approach. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama, Mistral, and Qwen models on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, revealing the high redundancy in this presumed high-quality data construction manner. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (\texttt{DPO}) has emerged as a promising approach for solving the alignment problem in AI. In this paper, we make two counter-intuitive observations about \texttt{DPO}. First, we show that \texttt{DPO} loss could be derived by starting from an alternative optimization problem that only defines the KL guardrail on in-sample responses, unlike the original RLHF problem where guardrails are defined on the entire distribution. Second, we prove a surprising property of this alternative optimization problem, namely that under its optimal policy, both preferred and rejected responses tend to decrease in probability, a phenomenon typically displayed by DPO in practice. To control this behavior, we propose a set of constraints designed to limit the displacement of probability mass between the preferred and rejected responses in the reference and target policies. The resulting algorithm, which we call Constrained Controlled DPO (\texttt{C2-DPO}), has a meaningful RLHF interpretation. By hedging against the displacement, \texttt{C2-DPO} provides practical improvements over vanilla \texttt{DPO} when aligning several language models using standard preference datasets.

Abstract: The constant $\pi$ has fascinated scholars throughout the centuries, inspiring numerous formulas for its evaluation, such as infinite sums and continued fractions. Despite their individual significance, many of the underlying connections among formulas remain unknown, missing unifying theories that could unveil deeper understanding. The absence of a unifying theory reflects a broader challenge across math and science: knowledge is typically accumulated through isolated discoveries, while deeper connections often remain hidden. In this work, we present an automated framework for the unification of mathematical formulas. Our system combines large language models (LLMs) for systematic formula harvesting, an LLM-code feedback loop for validation, and a novel symbolic algorithm for clustering and eventual unification. We demonstrate this methodology on the hallmark case of $\pi$, an ideal testing ground for symbolic unification. Applying this approach to 455,050 arXiv papers, we validate 407 distinct formulas for $\pi$ and prove relations between 381 (94%) of them, of which 188 (46%) can be derived from a single mathematical object$\unicode{x2014}$linking canonical formulas by Euler, Gauss, Brouncker, and newer ones from algorithmic discoveries by the Ramanujan Machine. Our method generalizes to other constants, including $e$, $\zeta(3)$, and Catalan's constant, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted mathematics to uncover hidden structures and unify knowledge across domains.

Abstract: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code and demo at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

Abstract: Water quality is foundational to environmental sustainability, ecosystem resilience, and public health. Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offer transformative potential for large-scale water quality prediction and scientific insights generation. However, their widespread adoption in high-stakes decision-making, such as pollution mitigation and equitable resource allocation, is prevented by unresolved trustworthiness challenges including fairness, uncertainty, interpretability, robustness, generalizability, and reproducibility. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of trustworthiness in a continental-scale multi-task LSTM model predicting 20 water quality variables (encompassing physical/chemical processes, geochemical weathering, and nutrient cycling) across 482 U.S. basins. Our investigation uncovers systematic patterns of model performance disparities linked to basin characteristics, the inherent complexity of biogeochemical processes, and variable predictability, emphasizing critical performance fairness concerns. We further propose methodological frameworks for quantitatively evaluating critical aspects of trustworthiness, including uncertainty, interpretability, and robustness, identifying key limitations that could challenge reliable real-world deployment. This work serves as a timely call to action for advancing trustworthy data-driven methods for water resources management and provides a pathway to offering critical insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners seeking to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly in environmental management.

Abstract: Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition.

Abstract: Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.

Abstract: Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models have shown great promise. However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction. Experimental results show that OS-Kairos substantially outperforms existing models on our curated dataset featuring complex scenarios, as well as on established benchmarks such as AITZ and Meta-GUI, with 24.59\%$\sim$87.29\% improvements in task success rate. OS-Kairos facilitates an adaptive human-agent collaboration, prioritizing effectiveness, generality, scalability, and efficiency for real-world GUI interaction. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/OS-Kairos.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech.

<title>Evaluating how LLM annotations represent diverse views on contentious topics</title>

Abstract: Researchers have proposed the use of generative large language models (LLMs) to label data for research and applied settings. This literature emphasizes the improved performance of these models relative to other natural language models, noting that generative LLMs typically outperform other models and even humans across several metrics. Previous literature has examined bias across many applications and contexts, but less work has focused specifically on bias in generative LLMs' responses to subjective annotation tasks. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show systematic substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Rather, we find that multiple LLMs tend to be biased in the same directions on the same demographic categories within the same datasets. Moreover, the disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task -- a measure of item difficulty -- is far more predictive of LLM agreement with human annotators. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners using LLMs for automated data annotation tasks. Specifically, we emphasize that fairness evaluations must be contextual, model choice alone will not solve potential issues of bias, and item difficulty must be integrated into bias assessments.

<title>On Synthesizing Data for Context Attribution in Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage "in the wild". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as "hallucinations". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.

Abstract: Scholar Inbox is a new open-access platform designed to address the challenges researchers face in staying current with the rapidly expanding volume of scientific literature. We provide personalized recommendations, continuous updates from open-access archives (arXiv, bioRxiv, etc.), visual paper summaries, semantic search, and a range of tools to streamline research workflows and promote open research access. The platform's personalized recommendation system is trained on user ratings, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to individual researchers' interests. To further enhance the user experience, Scholar Inbox also offers a map of science that provides an overview of research across domains, enabling users to easily explore specific topics. We use this map to address the cold start problem common in recommender systems, as well as an active learning strategy that iteratively prompts users to rate a selection of papers, allowing the system to learn user preferences quickly. We evaluate the quality of our recommendation system on a novel dataset of 800k user ratings, which we make publicly available, as well as via an extensive user study. https://www.scholar-inbox.com/

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for driving offensive penetration-testing tooling. Due to the opaque nature of LLMs, empirical methods are typically used to analyze their efficacy. The quality of this analysis is highly dependent on the chosen testbed, captured metrics and analysis methods employed.
  This paper analyzes the methodology and benchmarking practices used for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven attacks, focusing on offensive uses of LLMs in cybersecurity. We review 19 research papers detailing 18 prototypes and their respective testbeds.
  We detail our findings and provide actionable recommendations for future research, emphasizing the importance of extending existing testbeds, creating baselines, and including comprehensive metrics and qualitative analysis. We also note the distinction between security research and practice, suggesting that CTF-based challenges may not fully represent real-world penetration testing scenarios.

<title>JEPA4Rec: Learning Effective Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation via Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10512</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.10512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language representation learning has emerged as a promising approach for sequential recommendation, thanks to its ability to learn generalizable representations. However, despite its advantages, this approach still struggles with data sparsity and a limited understanding of common-sense user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{JEPA4Rec}$, a framework that combines $\textbf{J}$oint $\textbf{E}$mbedding $\textbf{P}$redictive $\textbf{A}$rchitecture with language modeling of item textual descriptions. JEPA4Rec captures semantically rich and transferable representations, improving recommendation performance and reducing reliance on large-scale pre-training data. Specifically, JEPA4Rec represents items as text sentences by flattening descriptive information such as $\textit{title, category}$, and other attributes. To encode these sentences, we employ a bidirectional Transformer encoder with modified embedding layers tailored for capturing item information in recommendation datasets. We apply masking to text sentences and use them to predict the representations of the unmasked sentences, helping the model learn generalizable item embeddings. To further improve recommendation performance and language understanding, we employ a two-stage training strategy incorporating self-supervised learning losses. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that JEPA4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in cross-domain, cross-platform, and low-resource scenarios.

<title>Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13612</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

This paper uses an online experiment to identify non-instrumental image concerns as a key reason individuals underutilize AI recommendations. I show that concerns about how one is perceived, even when those perceptions carry no monetary consequences, lead participants to disregard AI advice and reduce task performance.

<title>AgentVigil: Generic Black-Box Red-teaming for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.05849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentVigil, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentVigil on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentVigil exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

arXiv:2505.06584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking (fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real environments.

arXiv:2505.07096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes. Code and videos are available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Sim/.

Fixed point explanations satisfy properties like minimality, stability, and faithfulness, revealing hidden model behaviours and explanatory weaknesses. We define convergence conditions for several classes of explainers, from feature-based to mechanistic tools like Sparse AutoEncoders, and we report quantitative and qualitative results.

<title>Learning to Rank Chain-of-Thought: An Energy-Based Approach with Outcome Supervision</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14999</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

arXiv:2505.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research directions to address them.

<title>FoMoH: A clinically meaningful foundation model evaluation for structured electronic health records</title>

arXiv:2505.16941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks. This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare. However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future healthcare foundation models.

<title>Transparency in Healthcare AI: Testing European Regulatory Provisions against Users' Transparency Needs</title>

arXiv:2505.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in healthcare and is pervasively incorporated into medical software and equipment. In the European Union, healthcare is a high-risk application domain for AI, and providers must prepare Instructions for Use (IFU) according to the European regulation 2024/1689 (AI Act). To this regulation, the principle of transparency is cardinal and requires the IFU to be clear and relevant to the users. This study tests whether these latter requirements are satisfied by the IFU structure. A survey was administered online via the Qualtrics platform to four types of direct stakeholders, i.e., managers (N = 238), healthcare professionals (N = 115), patients (N = 229), and Information Technology experts (N = 230). The participants rated the relevance of a set of transparency needs and indicated the IFU section addressing them. The results reveal differentiated priorities across stakeholders and a troubled mapping of transparency needs onto the IFU structure. Recommendations to build a locally meaningful IFU are derived.

<title>PARTONOMY: Large Multimodal Models with Part-Level Visual Understanding</title>

arXiv:2505.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts. Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images, encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only 5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks, such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks, remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g., multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently, they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive, hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded, hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench. Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1). These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.

<title>Train with Perturbation, Infer after Merging: A Two-Stage Framework for Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&amp;M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&amp;M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&amp;M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

<title>R-KV: Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.

<title>COGNATE: Acceleration of Sparse Tensor Programs on Emerging Hardware using Transfer Learning</title>

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics, driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

Abstract: We present a tractable, incremental framework for topological dialogue semantics based on finite, discrete semantic spaces. Building on the intuition that utterances correspond to open sets and their combinatorial relations form a simplicial complex (the dialogue nerve), we give a rigorous foundation, a provably correct incremental algorithm for nerve updates, and a reference implementation in the Wolfram Language. The framework supports negative nerve computation (inconsistency tracking), consequence extraction, and a transparent, set-theoretic ranking of entailments. We clarify which combinatorial properties hold in the discrete case, provide motivating examples, and outline limitations and prospects for richer logical and categorical extensions.

<title>From Argumentative Text to Argument Knowledge Graph: A New Framework for Structured Argumentation</title>

arXiv:2506.00713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

<title>KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache at a Large Cloud Provider</title>

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of 74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows in clinical practice.

<title>MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training. However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling approaches.

<title>Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The LLM decomposes tasks and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this framework, the aerial robot follows an optimized global semantic path and continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on real-world cube or object arrangement tasks demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.

arXiv:2506.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600 real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile sensing and active perception.

arXiv:2506.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for real-world conditions.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale, audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65% relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation, we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance.

arXiv:2506.07355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system constraints.

arXiv:2506.07431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs. Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at https://levo-demo.github.io/. Code is released at https://github.com/tencent-ailab/songgeneration.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes each private image into a concise textual description using image to text models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images, greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative decision-making, skill assessment, and postoperative quality improvement. However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are available upon request.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in training LLMs.

Summary:
The article discusses the formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model, particularly focusing on its use for directed knowledge representations and process modelling. It introduces the concept of a finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation that allows operations to scale to any level of semantic complexity. The Semantic Spacetime postulates aim to provide predictability with minimal constraints in graph pathways. The presence of absorbing states in partial graphs leads to information leakage, similar to the issue of division by zero, indicating a loss of closure and the need for manual insertion of remedial information. The origins of the Semantic Spacetime model, along with its Promise Theory, shed light on how absorbing states relate to boundary information where intentionality can be incorporated. <div>

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality can enter.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce DURA-CPS, a novel framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g., safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning) to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, DURA-CPS continuously evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our results show that DURA-CPS effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&amp;V in safety- and security-critical systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare, and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR. While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the field of KGR.

<div> OntoGSN; ontology; assurance cases; GSN standard; dynamic AC management

Summary:
The article introduces OntoGSN, an ontology and middleware designed to manage Assurance Cases (ACs) within the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. ACs are crucial for ensuring system properties like safety and robustness. Existing tools support static applications, but dynamic contexts like autonomous driving pose challenges. OntoGSN offers a knowledge representation graph that can be automatically updated and evaluated, making AC management more efficient. The ontology formalizes the GSN Community Standard v3, adhering strictly to the standard's text. It includes a helper ontology, parser for integration with AC tools, SPARQL query library with automation patterns, and a prototypical interface. The development process follows FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, and community feedback. The article demonstrates OntoGSN's utility with an example of ensuring adversarial robustness in large language models. Ongoing evaluations and community input guide the development of additional middleware elements to meet evolving needs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static, document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g., autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse, producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this, we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated, evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

<div> Keywords: clinical communication skills, LLM-powered simulations, fuzzy logic, automated evaluation, medical education

Summary: 

This paper presents a novel approach called LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge which combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the evaluation of medical students' clinical communication skills. By fine-tuning LLMs to assess students' utterances based on human annotations from fuzzy sets, the system can align with physicians' subjective preferences in assessing professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and contextual distractions. The methodology involved data collection, annotation, prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs. Results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in delivering human-aligned assessments. By leveraging fuzzy logic and LLMs, this work advances automated evaluation in medical education, supporting more robust assessment practices. The GitHub repository for this project is also available for further exploration and development. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports more robust assessment and judgment practices.

<div> Keywords: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Multi-label sound classification, IoT devices, Resource-constrained, MUDAS

Summary:
MUDAS is a new Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) framework designed for multi-label sound classification on resource-constrained IoT devices. Existing UDA algorithms are limited in their adaptability to multi-label tasks and in their ability to run efficiently on low-power devices. MUDAS addresses these constraints by selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data, minimizing computational and memory requirements. The framework also implements class-specific adaptive thresholds for generating reliable pseudo-labels and incorporates diversity regularization to enhance multi-label classification accuracy. Evaluation on the SONYC Urban Sound Tagging dataset shows that MUDAS outperforms existing UDA algorithms in urban sound classification, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. This framework demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and is well-suited for on-device deployment in challenging acoustic environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust, adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data, minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment. Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

Models struggle with descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering tasks compared to humans, with significant gaps between open-source and closed-source models. The study highlights challenges in chemistry-aware table understanding and positions ChemTable as a realistic benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2506.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity, limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition, covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding, encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances. Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored support for family caregivers.

Summary:<br />
In the field of end-to-end autonomous driving, motion prediction is crucial for ego-vehicle planning. Existing methods often overlook the significance of locally interacting agents in planning decisions, which can lead to overlooked risks and decreased reliability. To address this, FocalAD introduces the Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss) modules. ELAI focuses on local interactions to enhance motion representations, while FLA Loss prioritizes decision-critical neighboring agents in planning. Experimental results show that FocalAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive. Particularly, on the Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD significantly reduces the average collision rate, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in enhancing autonomous driving systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations. Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning. Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by 41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

<div> Keywords: autonomous vehicles, multi-agent reinforcement learning, local state attention, traffic situations, merging efficiency

Summary:

In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles need to interact with human-controlled vehicles and navigate unusual driving scenarios. This study approaches the problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) task with full cooperative reward among autonomous vehicles. The authors propose a Local State Attention module that utilizes self-attention to compress essential information from nearby agents and resolve conflicts in traffic situations. Through simulations of a highway merging scenario with a priority vehicle as an unexpected event, the module successfully manages the merging process by prioritizing information from other vehicles. Results show significant improvements in merging efficiency, especially in high-density traffic conditions. This approach addresses challenges faced by autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic environments and highlights the effectiveness of utilizing MARL with attention mechanisms in resolving conflicts and adapting to stochastic events.

arXiv:2506.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations. Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles' information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in high-density traffic settings.

<br />
Automated channel pruning for deep neural networks is crucial for optimizing computational efficiency. The proposed Structure-Aware Automatic Channel Pruning (SACP) framework utilizes graph convolutional networks to understand network topology and determine the global importance of each channel. By considering structural dependencies, SACP enables topology-aware pruning without the need for manual intervention. The framework restricts the space of pruning rate combinations and uses a search-based approach to find the optimal combination. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with models like ResNet and VGG16 show that SACP outperforms existing pruning methods in terms of compression efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. SACP proves to be an effective and automated solution for channel pruning in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated, reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and competitive on accuracy retention.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DSP+, an enhanced version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework, which combines neuro-symbolic techniques with existing reasoning models and tactic step provers for automated theorem proving. The framework improves performance in three phases: drafting concise natural-language subgoals, autoformalizing subgoals with hypotheses, and integrating symbolic search methods with step provers. Without training, DSP+ solves a significant number of problems from various benchmarks, including an unsolved IMO problem. The framework also identifies formalization errors in proof patterns, making them comprehensible to human experts. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of classical reasoning patterns in automated theorem proving alongside reinforcement learning techniques. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces \textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework, featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+ generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will be open-sourced.

<br />
Summary: In this work, the authors introduce RAG+, an extension of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that incorporates application-aware reasoning into the retrieval process. RAG+ utilizes a dual corpus of knowledge and application examples to enhance large language models' (LLMs) performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. By retrieving both knowledge and examples jointly during inference, LLMs are not only able to access relevant information but also apply it within structured reasoning processes. Experimental results across mathematical, legal, and medical domains show that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, with average improvements of 3-5% and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. This approach bridges the gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning, advancing a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, test-time collaboration, planner model, reasoner model, cross-model inference  
Summary:  
In the study, the researchers address the challenge of balancing the cost and effectiveness of utilizing large language models (LLMs) by proposing a test-time collaboration framework. This framework involves a planner model generating a plan as a high-level abstraction of the problem, guiding a reasoner model to generate a complete solution. Small and large LLMs collaborate by taking turns as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in multiple rounds to solve complex tasks effectively. The proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to expensive proprietary models while reducing dependence on paid inference, showcasing planning as a valuable tool for orchestrating cost-effective cross-model inference under real-world deployment constraints.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B) are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free) and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths? We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model, which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment constraints.

<br />
This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset for evaluating Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the German language. The dataset includes over 2,000 open-ended questions based on real middle school curricula in various subjects. Thirteen state-of-the-art VLMs were evaluated on the dataset, showing overall low accuracy, particularly in music, mathematics, and adversarial scenarios. The study highlights the discrepancies between performance on popular benchmarks and real-world tasks. Middle school-level tasks are proposed as a valuable avenue for testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol provide a thorough testbed for improving the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of AI systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Summary:<br />
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been effective in reducing hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by improving their attention to visual inputs. Existing methods have shown progress in this area but suffer from non-rigorous optimization and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO) is proposed. SymMPO utilizes symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision to enhance visual understanding in MLLMs while maintaining alignment with DPO. It introduces a preference margin consistency loss to regulate the preference gap between pairs. Evaluation across five benchmarks shows that SymMPO outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) were proposed for learning value functions in planning domains but fail to learn value functions defined by $C_2 features. The connection between GNN expressive power and $C_2 first-order logic with two variables and counting motivated R-GNNs. However, R-GNNs struggle to generalize to unseen problems and learn optimal value functions decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2 features. Empirical results show that prior GNN architectures for planning may be more effective in learning value functions defined by $C_2 features. Further exploration of GNN architectures for planning domains is needed to improve generalization and capability to learn value functions in line with $C_2 features. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$ features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features.

Summary:
The article investigates the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. It establishes the identifiability of the causal effect under certain conditions when data is available from multiple environments, assuming the target causal effect remains consistent across these environments. A moment-based algorithm is proposed for estimating the causal effect, with the restriction that only one parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments. The study demonstrates the loss of identifiability when both exogenous noise distributions of the latent and treatment variables vary across environments. Additionally, a procedure is outlined to identify the varying parameter of the data-generating mechanism across environments. Experimental evaluation on synthetic data validates the performance of the proposed methods. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Summary:<br /><br />This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accessible and interpretable estimates of house prices in the real estate market. By optimizing In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies, LLMs show effectiveness in leveraging hedonic variables for meaningful price estimates. While traditional machine learning models excel in predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more interactive and interpretable alternative. The study finds that LLMs can explain their predictions in line with state-of-the-art models, enhancing trustworthiness. However, LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and spatial reasoning limitations. By providing practical guidance for structured prediction tasks, the study highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing transparency in real estate appraisal. Stakeholders can benefit from actionable insights generated by LLMs in the real estate market. <div>

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are used to study social behavior, with a focus on political biases and interaction dynamics in debates. A study explores how LLM type and agent gender affect political bias through structured debates involving Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents. Results show Neutral agents align with Democrats, while Republicans shift towards neutrality. Agent gender influences attitudes, with agents adjusting opinions based on others' genders. Echo chambers form as agents with shared political affiliations intensify attitudes during debates, contrary to previous beliefs. This research sheds light on the complexities of political bias and interaction dynamics within debates involving LLMs and highlights the impact of model provenance and agent personas on political attitudes. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

Summary:
In this work, a cascaded LLM decision framework is proposed for effective human-AI decision-making. The framework involves delegating tasks across multiple tiers of expertise, including a base model, a large model, and a human expert. A deferral policy determines when to switch between models, while an abstention policy decides whether human intervention is necessary. An online learning mechanism is incorporated to improve decision quality over time. The approach is demonstrated in general and medical question-answering tasks, showing improved accuracy compared to single-model baselines, reduced cost, and a systematic way to handle abstentions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the \textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain} automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to handle abstentions.

Summary:
Schema-R1 is a new approach for schema linking in the Text-to-SQL task, focusing on improving reasoning ability. This model uses reinforcement learning and consists of three key steps: constructing high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for initialization, and rule-based reinforcement learning training. The goal is to enhance the schema linking model's ability to accurately predict table and column names in SQL queries. By optimizing for reasoning instead of rote-learning, Schema-R1 achieves a 10% improvement in filter accuracy compared to existing methods. The code for Schema-R1 is available on GitHub for further exploration and use. This new approach shows promise in advancing the field of schema linking and improving the performance of Text-to-SQL models.

arXiv:2506.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1 consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

Summary:  
- The study focuses on evaluating large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks through the lens of strategic games, measuring planning, revision, and decision making under resource constraints.  
- A framework is proposed to assess LLMs based on metrics like win rate, correction success rate, and improvement slope, with ChatGPT-o3-mini emerging as the top performer.

- Qwen-Plus struggles due to excessive resource use, despite a high overcorrection risk rate.  
- The results underscore the importance of understanding the internal processes of LLMs beyond just their final decisions, showcasing the need for evaluating not just the outcomes but also the reasoning behind them.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed, rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models, ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7 percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of 0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6 percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093), suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how they arrive at those decisions

Summary:<br /><br />
The 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) computational model aims to reduce the carbon footprint of computer workloads by dynamically shifting to cleaner energy sources. An experiment was conducted to evaluate FtS's effectiveness in minimizing carbon emissions in AI model training. Benchmarking four AI algorithms for anomaly detection showed FtS achieving up to 14.6% reduction in carbon emissions and aiding in training time preservation. Comparisons with other strategies like Flexible Start and Pause and Resume also revealed FtS as a promising approach. Utilizing historical carbon intensity data from seven European cities in the year 2021, the experiment highlighted FtS's potential to significantly lower carbon emissions in AI workloads, thus contributing to environmental sustainability in the field of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of 16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework that uses functional programming and type systems to automatically generate theorems from Scala backend code and verify them using LLM-based provers. The proposed method can verify over 50% of test requirements, potentially automating half of a testing engineer's workload. With an average cost of $2.19 per API, the LLM-based verification is cost-effective compared to manual testing and can be easily scaled through parallel execution. The framework has the potential to greatly improve engineering productivity by automating testing processes and identifying bugs accurately. The results demonstrate a promising direction towards scalable, AI-powered software testing, as advancements in models continue to evolve.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality, lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable, AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering productivity as models continue to advance.

Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) technology have enabled the translation of enterprise-level COBOL code to modern languages like Java or Python. However, ensuring the accuracy of the translated code remains a challenge. This study introduces a framework and tool for validating the equivalence between COBOL and translated Java code. By employing symbolic-execution-based test generation, unit tests are automatically generated for the original COBOL programs. These tests also simulate external resource calls for comprehensive coverage. Equivalent JUnit test cases with matching mock behaviors as in the COBOL code are generated and executed to verify semantic equivalence between the original and translated programs. The results can aid in code repair and provide valuable feedback for enhancing AI models. <br /><br />Summary: Recent advancements in Large Language Model technology have facilitated the translation of COBOL code to Java.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of ensuring the readiness of AI-enabled capabilities in military combat systems. It highlights the limitations of current technology readiness assessments in capturing critical AI-specific factors, potentially leading to deployment risks. The proposed AI Readiness Framework aims to evaluate the maturity and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems by assessing reliability, safety, and suitability for combat use. By expanding on traditional Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and utilizing existing data evaluation tools and testing practices, the framework offers a structured approach for decision-makers to determine if an AI-enabled system meets performance, transparency, and human integration standards for deployment with confidence. Implementation of this framework can advance defense technology management and risk assessment in the military sector.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability, safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and risk assessment.

Summary:<br />
In this paper, a new paradigm called EmbedAgent is introduced to assess Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks related to embedded system development. A comprehensive benchmark called Embedbench is proposed to evaluate LLMs on tasks such as embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration. Experiment results on 10 mainstream LLMs reveal that DeepSeek-R1 struggles with schematic information and generation tasks, while LLMs perform better on MicroPython compared to ESP-IDF in cross-platform migration. Chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge, while reasoning LLMs can overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Two strategies, retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback, are proposed to enhance LLM performance, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy for tasks such as schematic generation and cross-platform migration from Arduino to ESP32. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer, Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases, DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8% pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4% pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies: retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without. Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from 21.4% to 27.8%.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population, significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally, hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages. However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

It discusses the 5D components of data (structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) within the data life cycle and emphasizes the role of data agents in achieving specific goals. The concept of data scientist is introduced as an abstract entity that organizes data agents and their actions. The manuscript identifies discipline-induced data science, leading to the concept of pan-data science which integrates various disciplines with essential data science. It categorizes essential data science into computational and foundational areas and warns of a potential divergence between the two without a method to assess the usefulness of data universe discoveries. The manuscript suggests implementing rigorous approaches to evaluate the utility of data universe discoveries to prevent such divergence. <div>

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially, if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological "schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and workforce training in the age of large language models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks, and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity, we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic NLP, knowledge Q&amp;A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10 open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications operation scheduling.

<title>Eliminating Hallucination-Induced Errors in LLM Code Generation with Functional Clustering</title>

<div> Keywords: code generation, functional clustering, confidence score, autonomous deployment, error rate<br />
Summary:<br />
The article presents a black-box wrapper called functional clustering that aims to eliminate hallucination-induced errors in code generation LLMs while providing a confidence score. By executing candidate programs on a self-generated test suite and clustering those with identical I/O behavior, the wrapper offers a tunable confidence estimate based on the largest cluster's empirical mass. This approach significantly reduces error rates in returned answers, allowing users to trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. The method demonstrated on LiveCodeBench showed a decrease in error rates from ~65% to 2%, with a possibility to reach 0% at a conservative threshold while still answering a significant portion of prompts. Manual audits indicated that remaining mistakes were mainly due to prompt misinterpretation rather than random generation noise. The method's simplicity and applicability to closed-source APIs and future models make it a practical solution for dependable and autonomous code generation. <div>

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs, executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0% at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation, not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity. Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github (https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

Summary:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced code generation in software development, but a study on iterative improvement shows a 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after just five rounds. Different prompting strategies result in distinct vulnerability patterns, challenging the belief that LLM refinement enhances security. Human expertise is crucial in validating code between iterations to prevent the introduction of new security risks during supposed improvements. Practical guidelines are proposed for developers to address these risks effectively.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial code "improvements".

Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses the potential of personalized federated learning (PFL) as a distributed alternative to centralized training for foundation models. PFL allows clients to adapt AI models to individual user preferences without sharing data. The study evaluates PFL on a new benchmark for multi-modal tasks with realistic data distribution shifts, considering both data and model heterogeneity. To address data heterogeneity, a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method is proposed to provide customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, a dimension-invariant module enables knowledge sharing across different model architectures. Empirical validations show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in personalization and generalization capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes, personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential, most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast, we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and generalization capabilities.

Summary: 
This paper investigates the impact of algorithmic lookism on synthetically generated faces and machine learning-based gender classification algorithms. Through experiments with 13,200 synthetic faces, the study reveals that text-to-image systems tend to associate facial attractiveness with unrelated positive traits like intelligence and trustworthiness. Additionally, gender classification models show higher error rates when classifying "less-attractive" faces, particularly among non-White women. These findings raise concerns about fairness in digital identity systems, highlighting the potential biases that can arise based on appearance and their implications for individuals' identities and opportunities. <div>

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I) systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital identity systems.

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case -- given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop. Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy. Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

The article introduces a new joint forecasting framework for time series prediction called YingLong. It differs from traditional methods and achieves high performance by utilizing a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer trained through masked token recovery. The framework shows that longer outputs improve model accuracy by allowing delayed chain-of-thought reasoning. To address output variance, a multi-input ensemble approach is utilized. Four foundation models with varying parameters are released, showcasing superior results in zero-shot tasks on ETT and Weather datasets.

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach. YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at https://huggingface.co/qcw1314/YingLong_300m

Forward Target Propagation (FTP) is proposed as an alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks. FTP replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass, eliminating the need for symmetric feedback weights and enabling modular and local learning. Results show competitive accuracies with backpropagation on various datasets and effective modeling of long-term dependencies. FTP outperforms backpropagation under quantized low-precision and hardware constraints, while also showing efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods. With its minimal computational overhead and forward-only nature, FTP offers promise for energy-efficient on-device learning and neuromorphic computing. <div>

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment, and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large, curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects, and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations -- suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting. Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases -- indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

Summary: 
A new runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning is developed to handle variations in hidden parameters, mitigating safety risks. This mechanism uses function encoders to infer hidden parameters from observations in real-time, enabling adaptation of the shield and policy online. By constraining the action space based on forecasting future safety risks and incorporating conformal prediction to account for uncertainty, the mechanism provides probabilistic safety guarantees and identifies optimal policies that adhere to safety constraints. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in reducing safety violations and achieving strong generalization beyond the training distribution, with minimal runtime overhead. <div>

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability. Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.

Summary:
This study introduces a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity theory, allowing for its integration into deep learning models through learnable gradient-based optimization. The Tversky projection layer, derived from this parameterization, proves superior to traditional linear projection layers in capturing non-linear relationships such as XOR functions. Experimentation demonstrates notable performance improvements in image classification and language modeling tasks when using Tversky projection layers. Notably, a ResNet-50 model adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a significant accuracy boost on the NABirds dataset. Additionally, implementing Tversky projection layers in GPT-2 results in reduced perplexity and parameter count. The study proposes a unified interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities to learned prototypes, supported by a novel visualization method enhancing interpretability. Overall, this work presents a novel approach to deep learning similarity models, fostering more interpretable networks rooted in a recognized theory of psychological similarity.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by classifier-free guidance (CFG) in text-to-image latent diffusion models, particularly in terms of color distortions in generated images when high guidance weights are applied. The distortions are attributed to norm amplification in the latent space. A theoretical framework is presented to explain the mechanisms behind this issue. The proposed Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm addresses the problem by restricting magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG outperforms existing methods, producing images with superior text alignment, improved color fidelity, and alignment with human perceptual preferences. The ADG algorithm effectively mitigates color distortions while maintaining enhanced text-image alignment at higher guidance weights. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However, traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of 98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs, compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems (CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints, coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules. We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an 8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4. Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/starjob42/ACCORD

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications. As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of 3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions. The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless, efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS) while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs, typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain. The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes. In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a neural network.

<title>STRCMP: Integrating Graph Structural Priors with Language Models for Combinatorial Optimization</title>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library. Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates 1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5% by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However, current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning, particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and equitable generation systems.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction (ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing lists.

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized training performance.

Abstract: Transforming sound insights into actionable streams of data, this abstract leverages findings from degree thesis research to enhance automotive system intelligence, enabling us to address road type [1].By extracting and interpreting acoustic signatures from microphones installed within the wheelbase of a car, we focus on classifying road type.Utilizing deep neural networks and feature extraction powered by pre-trained models from the Open AI ecosystem (via Hugging Face [2]), our approach enables Autonomous Driving and Advanced Driver- Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) to anticipate road surfaces, support adaptive learning for active road noise cancellation, and generate valuable insights for urban planning. The results of this study were specifically captured to support a compelling business case for next-generation automotive systems. This forward-looking approach not only promises to redefine passenger comfort and improve vehicle safety, but also paves the way for intelligent, data-driven urban road management, making the future of mobility both achievable and sustainable.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM) in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns. CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on reading evaluation systems and applications remains limited. We present a novel multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art recognition performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%, improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved reading mistake detection, increasing the F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results, and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors. These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling, bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4 declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements, both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code, docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+ for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API (https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture, data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows and AI-driven mathematical research

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for MX.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users. Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model. However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work, we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

<title>Two Birds with One Stone: Improving Factuality and Faithfulness of LLMs via Dynamic Interactive Subspace Editing</title>

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other. Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent, available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation, human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios, which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness, truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe deployment of these models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components, cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments, treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants (n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy, wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription. Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO). We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains. Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective, contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/parameterlab/c-seo-bench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/parameterlab/c-seo-bench.

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs) simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards. This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically, PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems. Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress, these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates. Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure. Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns. The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about 20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

<title>You Only Fine-tune Once: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-Tuning for Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification, summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns. This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

<title>Graph-based RAG Enhancement via Global Query Disambiguation and Dependency-Aware Reranking</title>

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners' mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities, facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However, current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue, we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically, Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics. However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning). To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks. Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each (evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution (OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community. Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1) Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide an easy-to-search project (https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the community.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2) The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews. (3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly communication.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based, English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$ in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in scientific text processing. Our code is available at https://github.com/yerimoh/MATTER

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions (InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions (InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral, LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM development. Our dataset\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/Infinity-Instruct} and codes\footnote{https://gitee.com/li-touch/infinity-instruct} have been publicly released.

<title>ScIRGen: Synthesize Realistic and Large-Scale RAG Dataset for Scientific Research</title>

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information needs of the scientific community.

<title>SDMPrune: Self-Distillation MLP Pruning for Efficient Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules, the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility, offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS) model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech, demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

<title>Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors</title>

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383 reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate. These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language model reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials, CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% - making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE) benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5 percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes domains.

<title>A Self-Refining Framework for Enhancing ASR Using TTS-Synthesized Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper, we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids -- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at https://github.com/voilalab/INR-benchmark.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods. This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm (SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference) scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured, trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer vision applications.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images, we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers, faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity recognition.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models (LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology, ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage, improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification accuracy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack. Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns, and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized healthcare systems.

<title>Beyond Formal Semantics for Capabilities and Skills: Model Context Protocol in Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies, Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system, where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven production systems.

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12 genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding), and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training. Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity prediction.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for balancing various fairness notions.

<title>RETUYT-INCO at BEA 2025 Shared Task: How Far Can Lightweight Models Go in AI-powered Tutor Evaluation?</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025 shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$ scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks, all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a GPU.

<title>No Universal Prompt: Unifying Reasoning through Adaptive Prompting for Temporal Table Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights. Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type, table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity, with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

<title>Can Time-Series Foundation Models Perform Building Energy Management Tasks?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets, have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited} generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM.

<title>Measuring multi-calibration</title>

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric. Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution. While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning, multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements, rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

This paper brings, side-by-side, the architecture representation of two systems that can be used as case studies for creating the metrics-based architectural model: the SPIRA and the Ocean Guard MLES.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development under realistic training scenarios.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures, which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence. Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically, Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE), where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded methodology.

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial relationships in the image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower, which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial relations.

<title>LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model</title>

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second, for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence improving robustness.

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training. Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified audio models from independently trained encoders.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare organizations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs without diminishing overall performance.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online recommendation services.

<title>Agent-RLVR: Training Software Engineering Agents via Guidance and Environment Rewards</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings, characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories. Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods struggle.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge" method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC) models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency, have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems. However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture, tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture, providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS). We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally, we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples. Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality, widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability, we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To facilitate future work, we will release code.

<title>Relational Schemata in BERT Are Inducible, Not Emergent: A Study of Performance vs. Competence in Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.11485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals. However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding, though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction through appropriate training.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead, thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach. These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The implementation is available at github.com/efthimia145/sid-composite-data-augmentation.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to avert or mitigate the severe health complications of this disease. Over recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting diabetes risk and are beneficial for practitioners. Objective: This study highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition, this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR. All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases. Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications, including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm. Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms and outline promising research directions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and defense.

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories, including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately 6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<title>Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation</title>

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4 can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant role in a partially automated process.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques. Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes. Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their personalized agents.

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data. These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence, Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature, there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation). Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e., influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in misleading influence attribution.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when applied to diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data. Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain. In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>GraphRAG-Causal: A novel graph-augmented framework for causal reasoning and annotation in news</title>

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities. We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations. Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and reduce hallucination rates.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned. A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected, demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research. Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment risks in LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it, we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate misalignment more generally.

<title>Evaluating Fairness and Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning: A Novel Technique using Tensor Data and Bayesian Regression</title>

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin color in ML models.

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue. To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents. RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with deployment practices and applicability across industries including manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient, and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally, we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical kernel-based methods.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However, publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology, which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling. Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at https://huggingface.co/collections/NLP-FBK/e3c-to-crf-67b9844065460cbe42f80166

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant, the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies in removing only the target information while leaving other information unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural explanations through Amnesic Probing.

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately 62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally, we discuss open research challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual multi-tabular reasoning.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing development of secure and responsible AI systems.

<title>Configurable Preference Tuning with Rubric-Guided Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts, such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at https://github.com/vicgalle/configurable-preference-tuning

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions: interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable, enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration, we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the Loihi neuromorphic system.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury, and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation, we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical motion.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.

<title>Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation.

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents. To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants, eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible guidance during sampling.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability, supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and wearable ECG applications.

<title>TrustGLM: Evaluating the Robustness of GraphLLMs Against Prompt, Text, and Structure Attacks</title>

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops. Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values, Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation, and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data. MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities, significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05; BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352), MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli (https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved from 71.44% to 73.21%.

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge: determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic, real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education tools.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks. The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent, hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70 elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra, as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

<title>LiveCodeBench Pro: How Do Olympiad Medalists Judge LLMs in Competitive Programming?</title>

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.

<title>Improving Large Language Model Safety with Contrastive Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard performance.

<title>Today's Cat Is Tomorrow's Dog: Accounting for Time-Based Changes in the Labels of ML Vulnerability Detection Approaches</title>

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul, ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models are not learning.

<title>Subjective Experience in AI Systems: What Do AI Researchers and the Public Believe?</title>

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and 838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by 2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment. Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups, especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts. We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components: (1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets, (3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world.

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on. As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering, classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms. This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor reservations.

<title>VGR: Visual Grounded Reasoning</title>

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains, its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers. Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development, enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.

<title>Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and Search with Generative Models for Game-Theoretic Opponent Modeling</title>

Abstract: Opponent modeling methods typically involve two crucial steps: building a belief distribution over opponents' strategies, and exploiting this opponent model by playing a best response. However, existing approaches typically require domain-specific heurstics to come up with such a model, and algorithms for approximating best responses are hard to scale in large, imperfect information domains.
  In this work, we introduce a scalable and generic multiagent training regime for opponent modeling using deep game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We first propose Generative Best Respoonse (GenBR), a best response algorithm based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a learned deep generative model that samples world states during planning. This new method scales to large imperfect information domains and can be plug and play in a variety of multiagent algorithms. We use this new method under the framework of Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO), to automate the generation of an \emph{offline opponent model} via iterative game-theoretic reasoning and population-based training. We propose using solution concepts based on bargaining theory to build up an opponent mixture, which we find identifying profiles that are near the Pareto frontier. Then GenBR keeps updating an \emph{online opponent model} and reacts against it during gameplay. We conduct behavioral studies where human participants negotiate with our agents in Deal-or-No-Deal, a class of bilateral bargaining games. Search with generative modeling finds stronger policies during both training time and test time, enables online Bayesian co-player prediction, and can produce agents that achieve comparable social welfare and Nash bargaining score negotiating with humans as humans trading among themselves.

Abstract: Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery) requires identifying relevant documents from vast collections for legal production requests. While artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have improved document review efficiency, current methods still struggle with legal entities, citations, and complex legal artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce DISCOvery Graph (DISCOG), an emerging system that integrates knowledge graphs for enhanced document ranking and classification, augmented by LLM-driven reasoning. DISCOG outperforms strong baselines in F1-score, precision, and recall across both balanced and imbalanced datasets. In real-world deployments, it has reduced litigation-related document review costs by approximately 98\%, demonstrating significant business impact.

Abstract: The impressive performance of ChatGPT and other foundation-model-based products in human language understanding has prompted both academia and industry to explore how these models can be tailored for specific industries and application scenarios. This process, known as the customization of domain-specific foundation models (FMs), addresses the limitations of general-purpose models, which may not fully capture the unique patterns and requirements of domain-specific data. Despite its importance, there is a notable lack of comprehensive overview papers on building domain-specific FMs, while numerous resources exist for general-purpose models. To bridge this gap, this article provides a timely and thorough overview of the methodology for customizing domain-specific FMs. It introduces basic concepts, outlines the general architecture, and surveys key methods for constructing domain-specific models. Furthermore, the article discusses various domains that can benefit from these specialized models and highlights the challenges ahead. Through this overview, we aim to offer valuable guidance and reference for researchers and practitioners from diverse fields to develop their own customized FMs.

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) have shown remarkable performance in various applications, yet they often struggle to recognize and appropriately respond to hard queries that conflict with their role-play knowledge. To investigate RPAs' performance when faced with different types of conflicting requests, we develop an evaluation benchmark that includes contextual knowledge conflicting requests, parametric knowledge conflicting requests, and non-conflicting requests to assess RPAs' ability to identify conflicts and refuse to answer appropriately without over-refusing. Through extensive evaluation, we find that most RPAs behave significant performance gaps toward different conflict requests. To elucidate the reasons, we conduct an in-depth representation-level analysis of RPAs under various conflict scenarios. Our findings reveal the existence of rejection regions and direct response regions within the model's forwarding representation, and thus influence the RPA's final response behavior. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight representation editing approach that conveniently shifts conflicting requests to the rejection region, thereby enhancing the model's refusal accuracy. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our editing method, improving RPAs' refusal ability of conflicting requests while maintaining their general role-playing capabilities.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies, although optimal in terms of task rewards, may not align with the personal preferences of human users. To ensure this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs.

Abstract: As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) grows to address complex real-world tasks, single models are often insufficient, requiring the integration of multiple models into pipelines. This paper introduces Bel Esprit, a conversational agent designed to construct AI model pipelines based on user-defined requirements. Bel Esprit employs a multi-agent framework where subagents collaborate to clarify requirements, build, validate, and populate pipelines with appropriate models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in generating pipelines from ambiguous user queries, using both human-curated and synthetic data. A detailed error analysis highlights ongoing challenges in pipeline construction. Bel Esprit is available for a free trial at https://belesprit.aixplain.com.

Abstract: Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.

Abstract: The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of context-aware reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated their capabilities across a variety of tasks. However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge from natural language remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active experience with the physical world. Given this scenario, semantic knowledge graphs can serve as conceptual spaces that guide the automated text generation reasoning process to achieve more efficient and explainable results. In this paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the explicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and applies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical connections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three metaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they require deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this integrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in understanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning processes, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding, especially for domain-specific metaphors. Furthermore, we propose a thorough error analysis, discussing issues with metaphorical annotations and current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Despite AI's impressive achievements, including recent advances in generative and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI systems to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond their training data. AI models consistently fail to make robust enough predictions when facing unfamiliar or adversarial data. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle to address this issue, due to an overemphasis on data fitting, while current uncertainty quantification approaches suffer from serious limitations. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn from what they know while at the same time acknowledging their ignorance, using the mathematics of second-order uncertainty measures. This approach, which leverages the expressive power of such measures to efficiently manage uncertainty, offers an effective way to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, allowing them to better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of chemistry literature poses significant challenges for researchers seeking to efficiently access domain-specific knowledge. To support advancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs derived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source text segment to ensure traceability and contextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource for chemistry NLP research, education, and tool development.

<title>Does Thinking More always Help? Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04210</link>

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions. Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale grows.

Abstract: Feature Visualization (FV) is a widely used technique for interpreting the concepts learned by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which synthesizes input patterns that maximally activate a given feature. Despite its popularity, the trustworthiness of FV explanations has received limited attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, Gradient Slingshots, that enables manipulation of FV without modifying the model architecture or significantly degrading its performance. By shaping new trajectories in the off-distribution regions of the activation landscape of a feature, we coerce the optimization process to converge in a predefined visualization. We evaluate our approach on several DNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to replace faithfuls FV with arbitrary targets. These results expose a critical vulnerability: auditors relying solely on FV may accept entirely fabricated explanations. To mitigate this risk, we propose a straightforward defense and quantitatively demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of probabilistic generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportional to their rewards. One big challenge of GFlowNets is training them effectively when dealing with long time horizons and sparse rewards. To address this, we propose Evolution guided generative flow networks (EGFN), a simple but powerful augmentation to the GFlowNets training using Evolutionary algorithms (EA). Our method can work on top of any GFlowNets training objective, by training a set of agent parameters using EA, storing the resulting trajectories in the prioritized replay buffer, and training the GFlowNets agent using the stored trajectories. We present a thorough investigation over a wide range of toy and real-world benchmark tasks showing the effectiveness of our method in handling long trajectories and sparse rewards. We release the code at http://github.com/zarifikram/egfn.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/wkwan7/DiffTORI.

Abstract: Reconstructing the hand mesh from one single RGB image is a challenging task because hands are often occluded by other objects. Most previous works attempt to explore more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms for improving 3D reconstruction performance, while it would increase computational complexity simultaneously. To achieve a performance-reserving architecture with high computational efficiency, in this work, we propose a simple but effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network (i.e., HandS3C), which is the first time to incorporate state space model into the task of hand mesh reconstruction. In the network, we design a novel state-space spatial-channel attention module that extends the effective receptive field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances regional features of hands in the channel dimension. This helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets facing heavy occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandS3C achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameters.

<title>PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness.
  In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt.
  We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/BHui97/PLeak.

Abstract: Previous industrial anomaly detection methods often struggle to handle the extensive diversity in training sets, particularly when they contain stylistically diverse and feature-rich samples, which we categorize as feature-rich anomaly detection datasets (FRADs). This challenge is evident in applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a efficient autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs. In our methodology, any dataset can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly detection, in a way that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: The representation of feature space is a crucial environment where data points get vectorized and embedded for subsequent modeling. Thus the efficacy of machine learning (ML) algorithms is closely related to the quality of feature engineering. As one of the most important techniques, feature generation transforms raw data into an optimized feature space conducive to model training and further refines the space. Despite the advancements in automated feature engineering and feature generation, current methodologies often suffer from three fundamental issues: lack of explainability, limited applicability, and inflexible strategy. These shortcomings frequently hinder and limit the deployment of ML models across varied scenarios. Our research introduces a novel approach adopting large language models (LLMs) and feature-generating prompts to address these challenges. We propose a dynamic and adaptive feature generation method that enhances the interpretability of the feature generation process. Our approach broadens the applicability across various data types and tasks and offers advantages over strategic flexibility. A broad range of experiments showcases that our approach is significantly superior to existing methods.

Abstract: In the field of computational advertising, the integration of ads into the outputs of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to support these services without compromising content integrity. This paper introduces novel auction mechanisms for ad allocation and pricing within the textual outputs of LLMs, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a segment auction where an ad is probabilistically retrieved for each discourse segment (paragraph, section, or entire output) according to its bid and relevance, following the RAG framework, and priced according to competing bids. We show that our auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare, a new notion of welfare that balances allocation efficiency and fairness, and we characterize the associated incentive-compatible pricing rule. These results are extended to multi-ad allocation per segment. An empirical evaluation validates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach over several ad auction scenarios, and exhibits inherent tradeoffs in metrics as we allow the LLM more flexibility to allocate ads.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become an important way of information access, there have been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread of unethical content, including implicit bias that hurts certain populations without explicit harmful words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development. Our code, data, and benchmarks are available at https://yuchenwen1.github.io/ImplicitBiasEvaluation/.

Abstract: We introduce a new type of indirect, cross-modal injection attacks against visual language models that enable creation of self-interpreting images. These images contain hidden "meta-instructions" that control how models answer users' questions about the image and steer models' outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view.
  Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form of prompt injection. Adversarial images look natural and the model's answers are coherent and plausible, yet they also follow the adversary-chosen interpretation, e.g., political spin, or even objectives that are not achievable with explicit text instructions.
  We evaluate the efficacy of self-interpreting images for a variety of models, interpretations, and user prompts. We describe how these attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of self-interpreting content that carries spam, misinformation, or spin. Finally, we discuss defenses.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.

Abstract: Traditional industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction. We provide demo videos and detailed data on GitHub: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLM4IAS.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: In the post-training of large language models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach to achieve generation aligned with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allows for policy training with a simple binary cross-entropy loss without a reward model. The objective of DPO is regularized by reverse KL divergence that encourages mode-seeking fitting to the reference policy. Nonetheless, we indicate that minimizing reverse KL divergence could fail to capture a mode of the reference distribution, which may hurt the policy's performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for control over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's sharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our experiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks, demonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks. Moreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to the loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for wide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce OneDiffusion, a versatile, large-scale diffusion model that seamlessly supports bidirectional image synthesis and understanding across diverse tasks. It enables conditional generation from inputs such as text, depth, pose, layout, and semantic maps, while also handling tasks like image deblurring, upscaling, and reverse processes such as depth estimation and segmentation. Additionally, OneDiffusion allows for multi-view generation, camera pose estimation, and instant personalization using sequential image inputs. Our model takes a straightforward yet effective approach by treating all tasks as frame sequences with varying noise scales during training, allowing any frame to act as a conditioning image at inference time. Our unified training framework removes the need for specialized architectures, supports scalable multi-task training, and adapts smoothly to any resolution, enhancing both generalization and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance across tasks in both generation and prediction such as text-to-image, multiview generation, ID preservation, depth estimation and camera pose estimation despite relatively small training dataset.

<title>Bi-directional Mapping of Morphology Metrics and 3D City Blocks for Enhanced Characterization and Generation of Urban Form</title>

Abstract: Urban morphology, examining city spatial configurations, links urban design to sustainability. Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in performance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form generation, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap remains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation, caused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form, particularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of optimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban performance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively characterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse forms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of establishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex urban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance evaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to both characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban forms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing 3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the methodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We use neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding, urban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an effective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms through comparison. The proposed methodology tightly couples complex urban forms with morphology metrics, hence it can enable a seamless and bidirectional relationship between urban form generation and optimization in performance-driven urban design towards sustainable urban design and planning.

Abstract: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding the acquisition of linguistic skills. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al., which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We perform neuron labeling to identify visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. We then demonstrate that these neurons can recognize objects beyond the model's original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the differences in representation between infant models and those in modern computer vision models, such as CLIP and ImageNet pre-trained model. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant visual and linguistic inputs.

<title>Evaluating Sample Utility for Efficient Data Selection by Mimicking Model Weights</title>

Abstract: Multimodal models are trained on large-scale web-crawled datasets, which often contain noise, bias, and irrelevant information. This motivates the use of data selection techniques, which can be divided into model-free variants, relying on heuristic rules and downstream datasets, and model-based approaches, such as those using influence functions. The former can be expensive to design and risks introducing unwanted dataset dependencies, while the latter are often computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose an efficient, model-based approach using the Mimic Score, a new data-quality metric that leverages the weights of a reference model to assess the usefulness of individual samples for training a new model. Our method relies on measuring alignments between training gradients and a target direction induced by this reference model. Building on the derived mimic scores, we develop Grad-Mimic: a framework that prioritizes samples to learn, estimates overall sample utility, and creates effective filters. Empirically, using mimic scores to guide training improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence, yields consistent performance gains across six image datasets, and enhances CLIP models with 20.7% fewer training steps. Moreover, mimic score-based filters complement existing filtering methods, e.g., training improved CLIP models with 4.7 million fewer samples while offering accurate estimation of dataset quality.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their robustness against adversarial misuse is crucial. This paper introduces the GAP (Graph of Attacks with Pruning) framework, an advanced approach for generating stealthy jailbreak prompts to evaluate and enhance LLM safeguards. GAP addresses limitations in existing tree-based LLM jailbreak methods by implementing an interconnected graph structure that enables knowledge sharing across attack paths. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates GAP's superiority over existing techniques, achieving a 20.8% increase in attack success rates while reducing query costs by 62.7%. GAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for attacking both open and closed LLMs, with attack success rates of >96%. Additionally, we present specialized variants like GAP-Auto for automated seed generation and GAP-VLM for multimodal attacks. GAP-generated prompts prove highly effective in improving content moderation systems, increasing true positive detection rates by 108.5% and accuracy by 183.6% when used for fine-tuning. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/dsbuddy/GAP-LLM-Safety.

Abstract: With the rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, accurate large-scale tree canopy height maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating above-ground biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-1 composite and Sentinel~2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs), offering precise and efficient responses by integrating external databases with pre-existing knowledge. However, we observe that these AIPSEs raise risks such as quoting malicious content or citing malicious websites, leading to harmful or unverified information dissemination. In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk type, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly querying a URL will increase the number of main risk-inclusive responses, while querying with natural language will slightly mitigate such risk. Compared to traditional search engines, AIPSEs outperform in both utility and safety. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4.1-based content refinement tool and a URL detector. Our evaluation shows that our defense can effectively reduce the risk, with only a minor cost of reducing available information by approximately 10.7%. Our research highlights the urgent need for robust safety measures in AIPSEs.

Abstract: As data continues to grow in volume and complexity across domains such as finance, manufacturing, and healthcare, effective anomaly detection is essential for identifying irregular patterns that may signal critical issues. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for advancing anomaly detection. They have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in enhancing anomaly identification, generating detailed data descriptions, and providing visual explanations. This survey presents the first comprehensive review of recent advancements in FM-based anomaly detection. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies FMs into three categories based on their roles in anomaly detection tasks, i.e., as encoders, detectors, or interpreters. We provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key challenges in leveraging FMs for improved anomaly detection. We also outline future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) combine visual understanding with natural language processing, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and video analysis. While VLMs show impressive capabilities across domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and healthcare, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to processing power, memory, and energy limitations. This survey explores recent advancements in optimizing VLMs for edge environments, focusing on model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and specialized hardware solutions that enhance efficiency. We provide a detailed discussion of efficient training and fine-tuning methods, edge deployment challenges, and privacy considerations. Additionally, we discuss the diverse applications of lightweight VLMs across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems, illustrating their growing impact. By highlighting key design strategies, current challenges, and offering recommendations for future directions, this survey aims to inspire further research into the practical deployment of VLMs, ultimately making advanced AI accessible in resource-limited settings.

<title>AB-UPT: Scaling Neural CFD Surrogates for High-Fidelity Automotive Aerodynamics Simulations via Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers</title>

arXiv:2502.09692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching the 100 millions, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained attention for its capacity to integrate information from different modalities. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models. The code of the toolkit is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/BalanceBenchmark.

Abstract: Being able to thoroughly assess massive multi-task language understanding (MMLU) capabilities is essential for advancing the applicability of multilingual language models. However, preparing such benchmarks in high quality native language is often costly and therefore limits the representativeness of evaluation datasets. While recent efforts focused on building more inclusive MMLU benchmarks, these are conventionally built using machine translation from high-resource languages, which may introduce errors and fail to account for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of the target languages. In this paper, we address the lack of native language MMLU benchmark especially in the under-represented Turkic language family with distinct morphosyntactic and cultural characteristics. We propose two benchmarks for Turkic language MMLU: TUMLU is a comprehensive, multilingual, and natively developed language understanding benchmark specifically designed for Turkic languages. It consists of middle- and high-school level questions spanning 11 academic subjects in Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tatar, Turkish, Uyghur, and Uzbek. We also present TUMLU-mini, a more concise, balanced, and manually verified subset of the dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate a diverse range of open and proprietary multilingual large language models (LLMs), including Claude, Gemini, GPT, and LLaMA, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across different languages, subjects, and alphabets. To promote further research and development in multilingual language understanding, we release TUMLU-mini and all corresponding evaluation scripts.

Abstract: Fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper aims to provide an in-depth interpretation of the fine-tuning process through circuit analysis, a popular tool in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). Unlike previous studies (Prakash et al. 2024; Chhabra et al. 2024) that focus on tasks where pre-trained models already perform well, we develop a set of mathematical tasks where fine-tuning yields substantial performance gains, which are closer to the practical setting. In our experiments, we identify circuits at various checkpoints during fine-tuning and examine the interplay between circuit analysis, fine-tuning methods, and task complexities. First, we find that while circuits maintain high node similarity before and after fine-tuning, their edges undergo significant changes, in contrast to prior work that shows circuits only add some additional components after fine-tuning. Based on these observations, we develop a circuit-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, which assigns ranks to layers based on edge changes in the circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our circuit-based LoRA algorithm achieves an average performance improvement of 2.46% over standard LoRA with similar parameter sizes. Furthermore, we explore how combining circuits from subtasks can enhance fine-tuning in compositional tasks, providing new insights into the design of such tasks and deepening the understanding of circuit dynamics and fine-tuning mechanisms.

Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning is fundamentally about transforming incomparable modalities into comparable representations. While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance. Code is released at https://github.com/MeganTj/multimodal_alignment.

<title>The Sharpness Disparity Principle in Transformers for Accelerating Language Model Pre-Training</title>

Abstract: Transformers consist of diverse building blocks, such as embedding layers, normalization layers, self-attention mechanisms, and point-wise feedforward networks. Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 2B and datasets of OpenWebText, MiniPile, and C4. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.

Abstract: Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.

<title>Naturalistic Computational Cognitive Science: Towards generalizable models and theories that capture the full range of natural behavior</title>

Abstract: How can cognitive science build generalizable theories that span the full scope of natural situations and behaviors? We argue that progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models that can accommodate these changes. We first review a growing body of research spanning neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI that suggests that incorporating a broader range of naturalistic experimental paradigms, and models that accommodate them, may be necessary to resolve some aspects of natural intelligence and ensure that our theories generalize. First, we review cases from cognitive science and neuroscience where naturalistic paradigms elicit distinct behaviors or engage different processes. We then discuss recent progress in AI that shows that learning from naturalistic data yields qualitatively different patterns of behavior and generalization, and discuss how these findings impact the conclusions we draw from cognitive modeling, and can help yield new hypotheses for the roots of cognitive and neural phenomena. We then suggest that integrating recent progress in AI and cognitive science will enable us to engage with more naturalistic phenomena without giving up experimental control or the pursuit of theoretically grounded understanding. We offer practical guidance on how methodological practices can contribute to cumulative progress in naturalistic computational cognitive science, and illustrate a path towards building computational models that solve the real problems of natural cognition, together with a reductive understanding of the processes and principles by which they do so.

Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/PFDial.

Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

<title>Safer or Luckier? LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.

<title>Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>

arXiv:2503.14293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) strongly depends on the quantity of training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients, which make it difficult to train accurate MLIPs. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. First, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, the student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset where the configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the COMP6 benchmark and show improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. The image-caption dataset, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/IBM/MS-CLIP.

arXiv:2504.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high memory and computation demand of large language models (LLMs) makes them challenging to be deployed on consumer devices due to limited GPU memory. Offloading can mitigate the memory constraint but often suffers from low GPU utilization, leading to low inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called pipelined offloading (PIPO), for efficient inference on consumer devices. PIPO designs a fine-grained offloading pipeline, complemented with optimized data transfer and computation, to achieve high concurrency and efficient scheduling for inference. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art baseline, PIPO increases GPU utilization from below 40% to over 90% and achieves up to 3.1$\times$ higher throughput, running on a laptop equipped with a RTX3060 GPU of 6GB memory.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs)aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To capture this complexity, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSALES), a novel task that integrates preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion within a unified conversational framework. To support realistic and systematic evaluation, we present CSUSER, an evaluation protocol with LLM-based user simulator grounded in real-world behavioral data by modeling fine-grained user profiles for personalized interaction. We also propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual user profiles and strategically selects actions through conversation. Comprehensive experiments show that CSI significantly improves both recommendation success and persuasive effectiveness across diverse user profiles.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) speech generation and voice cloning technologies have produced naturalistic speech and accurate voice replication, yet their influence on sociotechnical systems across diverse accents and linguistic traits is not fully understood. This study evaluates two synthetic AI voice services (Speechify and ElevenLabs) through a mixed methods approach using surveys and interviews to assess technical performance and uncover how users' lived experiences influence their perceptions of accent variations in these speech technologies. Our findings reveal technical performance disparities across five regional, English-language accents and demonstrate how current speech generation technologies may inadvertently reinforce linguistic privilege and accent-based discrimination, potentially creating new forms of digital exclusion. Overall, our study highlights the need for inclusive design and regulation by providing actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and organizations to ensure equitable and socially responsible AI speech technologies.

Abstract: Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.

arXiv:2504.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FreshStack, a holistic framework for automatically building information retrieval (IR) evaluation benchmarks by incorporating challenging questions and answers. FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic corpus collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation from community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support, retrieving documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid architectures. We use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing, recent, and niche topics to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On FreshStack, existing retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box, significantly underperform oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting plenty of headroom to improve IR quality. In addition, we identify cases where rerankers do not improve first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five topics) and oracle context helps an LLM generator generate a high-quality RAG answer. We hope FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing realistic, scalable, and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally, possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However, it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

Abstract: Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) are increasingly vital for location-based services in complex multi-storey environments. This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97\%, an F1-score of 61.99\%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19\%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.

Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.

Abstract: Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models' classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms, changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects, thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

<title>RSCF: Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter for Entity Embedding of Knowledge Graph</title>

Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation specific entity transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation has three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all relations and their frequencies.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more transparent and trustworthy.

Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization. However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

Abstract: Can AI effectively perform complex econometric analysis traditionally requiring human expertise? This paper evaluates AI agents' capability to master econometrics, focusing on empirical analysis performance. We develop an ``Econometrics AI Agent'' built on the open-source MetaGPT framework. This agent exhibits outstanding performance in: (1) planning econometric tasks strategically, (2) generating and executing code, (3) employing error-based reflection for improved robustness, and (4) allowing iterative refinement through multi-round conversations. We construct two datasets from academic coursework materials and published research papers to evaluate performance against real-world challenges. Comparative testing shows our domain-specialized AI agent significantly outperforms both benchmark large language models (LLMs) and general-purpose AI agents. This work establishes a testbed for exploring AI's impact on social science research and enables cost-effective integration of domain expertise, making advanced econometric methods accessible to users with minimal coding skills. Furthermore, our AI agent enhances research reproducibility and offers promising pedagogical applications for econometrics teaching.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers' legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines. Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL). Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However, we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective. We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference time without retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution, explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution, which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI. However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e., artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance.

Summary:<br />
The article presents the development and validation of a new questionnaire, LLM-D12, to measure dependency on large language models (LLMs). The questionnaire consists of 12 items organized into two factors: Instrumental Dependency and Relationship Dependency. Instrumental Dependency assesses reliance on LLMs for decision-making and cognitive tasks, while Relationship Dependency captures perceptions of LLMs as socially meaningful entities. The scale demonstrated excellent internal consistency and discriminant validity. The study highlights the nuanced nature of dependency on LLMs, suggesting that such dependency may not indicate dysfunction but could become problematic in certain contexts. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the LLM-human relationship and provide a valuable tool for assessing dependency on LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Summary:
The article introduces a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization (HAPO) method to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for reliable robotic deployment. The HAPO method involves human intervention to correct failures and collect interaction trajectories. These trajectories are used in action preference optimization to improve VLA models' adaptability and failure mitigation. An adaptive reweighting algorithm addresses issues related to introducing preference optimization into VLA models. The method enables VLA models to learn from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Experimental results in simulation and real-world scenarios demonstrate the framework's superior generalization and robustness in various manipulation tasks. By combining human intervention with action preference optimization, the HAPO method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models.

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.

In this paper, the authors investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) and address two key challenges: reliance on safeguards and the vanishing advantage problem. They propose a new approach called Regressive GRPO (Reg-GRPO) for training video LLMs, which reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task to directly predict the advantage. By eliminating the need for safeguards, such as clipping and min functions, Reg-GRPO provides more direct policy guidance. Additionally, a difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to enhance training samples at solvable difficulty levels, improving the diversity and informativeness of reward signals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DeepVideo-R1 model outperforms existing methods in video reasoning tasks, showcasing significant enhancements in video reasoning performance across various benchmarks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

Summary:  
This article introduces a conjecture that formalizes a trade-off between provable correctness and data-mapping capacity in AI systems. It suggests that systems aiming for deductive guarantees have a narrow operational domain, while those handling high-dimensional data sacrifice error-free performance. By making this trade-off explicit, the conjecture challenges engineering goals and philosophical expectations in AI. It presents the conjecture in an information-theoretic form and relates it to debates in epistemology and technology philosophy. The analysis discusses implications such as underdetermination and moral responsibility, highlighting the need for new evaluation standards and governance in AI design. Overall, the conjecture could reshape how AI systems are evaluated and governed, emphasizing the importance of verifying the inequality for trustworthy AI in the future.

arXiv:2506.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Summary:
This perspective discusses the limitations of current medical foundation models in adapting to new populations, specialties, or settings without retraining. It highlights the challenge of contextual errors, where models fail to consider critical patient-specific information due to their inability to dynamically adjust their reasoning across evolving clinical situations. The authors propose a vision for context-switching AI in healthcare, envisioning models that can dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles. This innovation aims to enhance the ability of AI models to diagnose, manage, and treat a variety of diseases across different medical specialties and regions. Ultimately, the goal is to improve access to medical care by developing AI systems that can effectively interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to diverse clinical contexts.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective, we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and regions, and expand access to medical care.

Summary:
This study explores the relationship between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. By utilizing the XGBoost algorithm, the researchers identified key features influencing AD classification, such as cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. The results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between causation and correlation in AD research, highlighting that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation. Integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis lays the groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data. By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, safety, fairness, transparency, accountability

Summary:
In the study of artificial intelligence (AI), the focus is on ensuring responsible and trustworthy AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable. The research extends safety techniques to ensure resilience against delayed observations, particularly in the context of autonomous vehicles, to prevent collisions with road users. Fairness shields are introduced to enforce group fairness in decision-making processes over finite time horizons, balancing fairness with minimal interference. A formal framework for assessing intentional behavior in decision-making agents is proposed, providing quantitative metrics for agency and intention quotient. This allows for retrospective analysis of intention to determine responsibility in case of unintended harm caused by autonomous systems. The research is unified under the "reactive decision-making" framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches for the development of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints, this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches. Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

<div> Large Language Models, Strategic Reasoning Benchmark, Wargame, Multi-Agent Decision-Making, Counterfactual Reasoning <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new benchmark, WGSR-Bench, to assess Large Language Models’ (LLMs) strategic reasoning abilities in wargame scenarios. While LLMs have shown proficiency in mathematical and symbolic reasoning, strategic reasoning – essential in dynamic environments – has not been thoroughly evaluated. WGSR-Bench focuses on three core tasks: Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling, and Policy generation, encapsulating the S-POE architecture. These tasks aim to assess LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. By designing test samples around wargame scenarios, which involve uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and strategic choices, the benchmark evaluates LLMs’ strategic reasoning skills comprehensively. The ultimate goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in strategic reasoning and advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence. <div>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks, particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity, concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities, marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Summary:<br />
1. The study establishes computational complexity barriers to verifying AI safety as AI system capabilities scale. 
2. For AI systems with high expressiveness, safety verification becomes exponentially time-consuming and coNP-complete. 
3. The Capability-Risk Scaling dynamic shows that increasing AI capability raises societal safety requirements towards perfection, leading to tension with verification complexity. 
4. Verification complexity grows exponentially with system expressiveness, indicating practical safety requirements fall within a region of computational intractability. 
5. The strategic trilemma presented suggests AI development must either constrain system complexity, accept unverifiable risks, or develop new safety paradigms beyond verification. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems, we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces VGC-Bench, a benchmark for developing AI agents that can adapt to diverse strategic landscapes in Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC). With a massive space of possible team configurations, the domain poses a unique challenge for generalization. VGC-Bench provides infrastructure, evaluation protocols, and baselines for research. Various methods, from large-language models to reinforcement learning, are evaluated and compared on a range of team sizes. In a single-team setting, the methods can outperform a professional VGC competitor. However, challenges arise when scaling up to larger team sets, highlighting the difficulty of policy generalization across diverse strategies. The research code is open-sourced for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately $10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete, combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the community. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/cameronangliss/VGC-Bench.

Summary:
Optimus-3 is a general-purpose agent for Minecraft that addresses challenges in building a generalist agent with perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments. The agent leverages a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide high-quality training data and introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing to mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks. Furthermore, a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach enhances the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Experimental results show that Optimus-3 outperforms both generalist multimodal large language models and state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

Summary:<br />
NeuroPAL introduces a neuroevolutionary framework combining NEAT with PAL to enhance evolutionary training efficiency in StarCraft: Brood War macromanagement. PAL alternates between frequent, low-fidelity training and high-fidelity evaluations, improving sample efficiency and allowing quicker strategy discovery. In a single-race scenario, NeuroPAL outperformed standard NEAT-based training, reaching competitive levels in half the time. Evolved agents displayed expert strategies like proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization. Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL show promise in enhancing neuroevolution scalability and effectiveness in complex real-time strategy environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

The paper introduces the Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module, which abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and meta-skills, creating a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. It also proposes the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm to leverage offline-acquired skills for online task planning.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap, we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems.

<div> Keywords: Edge computing, autoscaling, agent-based framework, multi-dimensional, SLO performance

Summary: 
This research introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework for edge computing that dynamically adjusts hardware resources and service configurations to meet requirements in resource-constrained environments. Four scaling agents, including Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, are compared using real-world processing services for visual recognition and QR code detection. Results show that all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with different convergence patterns. The Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis agent converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and suggests potential for further research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.

Summary: 
OIBench is introduced as a challenging olympiad-level informatics dataset with 250 original problems, aiming to guide algorithmic reasoning improvements. The dataset is carefully curated to assess various programming paradigms and complexities, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation. Time/Space Completion Curves are proposed for efficient analysis, and high-level participant evaluations enable human-model comparisons. Experiments show that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models surpass human participants in correctness and efficiency but are still suboptimal compared to canonical solutions.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning. This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities, and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities for future LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

<div> benchmark, large language models, logical planning, relational reasoning, performance evaluation

Summary:
The article introduces LogiPlan, a benchmark for assessing large language models in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures. It includes three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question, testing models' ability to construct valid graphs, identify inconsistencies, and determine relationship validity. The benchmark allows for dynamic task complexity variation and assesses models' self-correction capabilities. State-of-the-art models were evaluated, revealing performance gaps correlated with model scale and architecture. While reasoning-enhanced models showed promise on simpler tasks, they struggled with more complex configurations requiring deeper logical planning. Overall, LogiPlan provides a fine-grained assessment of model performance in logical reasoning tasks, highlighting challenges in handling complex relational structures for large language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1) Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3) Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models' self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B, O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring deeper logical planning.

<div> Keywords: Primender sequence, integer sequence, symbolic reasoning, Large Language Models, number theory.

Summary: 
The Primender sequence is introduced, incorporating prime numbers and modular digit-based conditions. This sequence is designed to evaluate the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. A hypothesis is explored regarding the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sequence. Various state-of-the-art models are tested on inferring the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating future terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy and sequence validity are used to assess model performance. This study contributes a new mathematical concept and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking Large Language Models in symbolic reasoning and pattern generalization. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it, the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that leverages minimal causal relationship information between subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

The dataset consists of 500 question-answer pairs covering various topics in the field. The QnAs are generated from problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. Evaluation of open-source LLMs shows that models explicitly designed for mathematical reasoning perform best on TeleMath, while general-purpose models struggle with these domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.

Summary: <br />
This work-in-progress paper discusses the formalization and verification of modeling constraints in AutomationML (AML) for standardized data exchange in engineering. The current recommendations for AML modeling are typically presented as informal textual constraints, making automatic validation within AML challenging. However, the proposed pipeline addresses this issue by mapping AML models to OWL ontologies using RML and SPARQL. Textual rules are translated into SHACL constraints by a Large Language Model, which are then validated against the AML ontology. The validation results are automatically interpreted in natural language. By demonstrating the approach on a sample AML recommendation, the study showcases that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked without requiring users to have a deep understanding of formal methods or ontology technologies. <div>

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem. While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a framework that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with the Model Context Protocol to enhance large language models' ability to simulate human spatiotemporal behaviors.

High generation quality scores were achieved across different base models. Parallel processing experiments showed efficiency improvements in sample generation times.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition, lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies. This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation. Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to 0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling, advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and participatory urban design applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces ToxiMol, a benchmark task for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focusing on molecular toxicity repair. A standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 toxic molecules was constructed, guided by expert toxicological knowledge. An automated evaluation framework called ToxiEval was proposed, integrating toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity for repair success measurement. The study assessed nearly 30 mainstream MLLMs and conducted ablation studies to analyze key factors like evaluation criteria and candidate diversity. Results showed that while current MLLMs face challenges, they are showing promise in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing. <div>

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards, mathematical reasoning, spurious rewards, code reasoning

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) shows promise in enhancing mathematical reasoning in certain models, even with spurious rewards that may not be directly correlated with the correct answer. The study demonstrates significant performance improvements in the MATH-500 task for the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model using various types of spurious rewards. However, these gains are not necessarily transferable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. Notably, RLVR increases the frequency of code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models. The researchers suggest that RLVR may elicit useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining when faced with a lack of useful reward signals. Future research on RLVR should consider diverse model testing, as the effectiveness of spurious rewards varies across model types. The exact mechanisms behind the efficacy of RLVR with spurious rewards remain a topic for further investigation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the 29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely spurious reward signals.

<div> Keywords: Tina, reasoning models, cost-efficiency, reinforcement learning, LoRA

Summary:
Tina is a family of tiny reasoning models developed with high cost-efficiency, demonstrating that strong reasoning abilities can be achieved using minimal resources. By employing parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning (RL) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a 1.5B parameter base model, Tina achieves competitive reasoning performance with state-of-the-art RL models. The best Tina model shows more than 20% reasoning performance increase and 43.33% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24 at a significantly reduced post-training cost of $9 USD, representing a 260x cost reduction compared to existing models. This approach effectively adapts the model to the rewarded reasoning structure while retaining the base model's knowledge.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA. We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code, training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

<div> SAE-Tuning, reasoning models, sparse autoencoder tuning, strong reasoning, language models

Summary: 
The study introduces Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained using a sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure, aiming to elicit strong reasoning in language models efficiently. This method involves training an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model and using it to guide supervised fine-tuning in a target model without direct reasoning traces. Results show that SAE-Tuning can retain over 97% of reasoning performance seen in RL-trained models while significantly reducing training costs and time. Furthermore, applying SAE-Tuning to lightly RL-trained models leads to improved reasoning performance at minimal additional cost. The extracted reasoning abilities are both generalizable and modular, demonstrating their transferability to different datasets and models. Ablations support these findings, and all related artifacts are openly available. <div>

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1 and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining, and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in transmitting high-resolution virtual scenes between cloud platforms and VR devices in the metaverse. It introduces the Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service (SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, comprising three modules for VR video semantic transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By utilizing semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers to transmit key semantic information instead of bit-level data, the architecture effectively reduces latency, resolves resource-bandwidth conflicts, and mitigates channel interference. The cloud handles video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction rendering modules to enhance immersive services. Tested on Meta Quest Pro, the SC-CEE-Meta architecture demonstrates significant improvements in reducing wireless transmission delay by 96.05% and enhancing image quality by 43.99% even under poor channel conditions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service (SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

<div> Keywords: Traffic Accident Anticipation, Attentive Video Diffusion, Equivariant TAA, Dashcam videos, Causal video frames

Summary:
Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) is a challenging problem in traffic scenes aiming for zero fatalities. Current supervised learning approaches for TAA face difficulties due to the unpredictable and evolving nature of traffic scenes. To address this issue, an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model is proposed, generating causal video frames from normal dashcam clips. AVD can be trained without additional annotations and enables Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) by creating contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Experimental results show competitive performance compared to existing methods. The AVD model synthesizes accident-related content based on text prompts, maintaining the original style and content of frames. This approach enhances TAA accuracy and mitigates data bias, potentially contributing to safer driving environments.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations. Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been obtained.

2. Bidirectional cross-modal GAN performs context-aware feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities to enhance accuracy.<br />

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&amp;E or IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This architecture elevates single-modality H&amp;E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28% reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred, single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms 22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&amp;E/IHC baselines respectively, with cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251 (IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse healthcare settings.

Summary:
Our work addresses the challenges in audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation by introducing a diffusion-based framework. We propose a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns different modalities such as text, audio, and emotion labels through contrastive learning, allowing for flexible emotion control. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers to enhance motion diversity while maintaining natural facial dynamics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics. The project page provides further details on the methodology and results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and (2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions. These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR) framework for accurately interpreting user intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information. The framework utilizes frequency-domain analysis to enhance intent understanding, with a wavelet-driven fusion module performing synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features. This enables fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics, improving semantic information extraction from non-verbal cues. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction mechanism facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration, bridging the gap between verbal and non-verbal information. Experimental results on MIntRec show state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods with a 1.13% increase in accuracy. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the wavelet-driven fusion module, leading to a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR) framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by 1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music, video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends, and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RAAI, a framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) using synthetic data. RAAI repurposes LLM attack techniques by detecting refusal signals and injecting predefined phrases to generate harmful yet fluent completions. Experiments show that RAAI significantly increases the harmful response rate of LLMs. Fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data from RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining performance on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This innovative approach demonstrates how LLM attack methodologies can be utilized as practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming. While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward, training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

<br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreak attacks in code generation, specifically focusing on their susceptibility to crafted prompts for generating malicious outputs. To address this issue, the authors introduce MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset comprising 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation. The dataset includes 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements that cover 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experimental results reveal that mainstream LLMs show limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, with an average rejection rate of 60.93%. However, this rate drops to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms, indicating a further reduction in the model's security capabilities. The study emphasizes the ongoing challenges in enhancing the code security capabilities of LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs, their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation, designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of LLMs still pose significant challenges.

<div> model, PII, privacy, memorization, attacks 
Summary:
Private Memorization Editing (PME) is introduced as a method to prevent leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach utilizes the memorization ability of LLMs to enhance privacy defense. PME detects and mitigates memorized PII by editing the model's knowledge of training data without affecting its performance. By leveraging knowledge from the training data, PME enhances the model's robustness against privacy attacks. The approach effectively reduces the leakage of PII in various settings, sometimes even completely thwarting privacy attacks. PME demonstrates the potential to enhance privacy protection in LLMs by utilizing their memorization capabilities for privacy defense. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs' memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the privacy attacks to zero.

Summary:
AQUA is introduced as a framework for protecting image knowledge in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, aiming to safeguard copyright in shared knowledge bases. It utilizes semantic signals embedded in synthetic images through acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. The methods are designed to withstand indirect watermark propagation, ensuring efficiency, effectiveness, and imperceptibility. Experiments demonstrate AQUA's ability to enable robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing in multimodal RAG, addressing a critical gap in protection methods. <div>

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

<div> pruning, text-to-image generation, diffusion transformers, FLUX, FastFLUX<br />
Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have led to the development of expressive models like diffusion transformers (DiTs), such as FLUX. However, these models have large parameter sizes, which result in slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods, such as single-step distillation and attention pruning, often suffer from performance degradation and high training costs. In response to these challenges, FastFLUX is introduced as an architecture-level pruning framework aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of FLUX. FastFLUX utilizes the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method to replace structurally complex residual branches with lightweight linear layers while maintaining original shortcut connections for stability. Additionally, the framework employs a localized fine-tuning strategy called Sandwich Training (ST) to mitigate performance drops due to structural replacement. Experimental results demonstrate that FastFLUX maintains high image quality while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20% of the hierarchy pruned.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs), exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs. To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability. Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

<div> diffusion models, synthetic images, image quality, text-to-image modeling, training framework
Summary:
Ambient Diffusion Omni presents a framework that utilizes low-quality and out-of-distribution images to enhance diffusion models. By leveraging the properties of natural images such as spectral power law decay and locality, this framework successfully trains diffusion models with synthetically corrupted images. The approach leads to state-of-the-art ImageNet FID scores and improves both image quality and diversity in text-to-image generative modeling. The key insight lies in utilizing noise to overcome the initial distribution skew, ultimately enhancing the learning process. The framework is theoretically justified by analyzing the trade-off between biased data and limited unbiased data throughout diffusion times. <div>
arXiv:2506.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

<div> Bayesian, uncertainty quantification, large language models, prompts, Metropolis-Hastings 

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of accurately quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs), which is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains. By viewing LLMs through a Bayesian lens and interpreting prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, the authors introduce a novel approach for uncertainty quantification. They propose Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods to perform Bayesian inference. This method enables principled uncertainty quantification over both the model's textual parameters and its predictions, while incorporating prior beliefs expressed in free-form text. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification on various LLM benchmarks and tasks, offering a promising pathway for integrating Bayesian methods into the era of large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source, black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts. This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text. To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based systems.

<div> Keywords: Semantic degeneracy, Large Language Models, Kolmogorov complexity, Interpretation, Contextuality

Summary: 
Semantic degeneracy, a property of natural language, poses challenges for modern NLP systems due to the increasing complexity of semantic expressions. The likelihood of recovering the single intended meaning diminishes as expression complexity grows, challenging the classical view of linguistic meaning. Meaning is proposed to be actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act rather than inherent in linguistic forms. A semantic Bell inequality test using LLM agents showed non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation under ambiguity. This challenges frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language and suggests Bayesian-style repeated sampling for more accurate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context. <div>
arXiv:2506.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent (human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach using autoregressive vision-language models.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities, maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges' weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across clients.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests. This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the task of multi-classifying images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence, encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD) learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also, results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning. Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified; instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However, for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally, we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation. Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

<title>Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective</title>

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants, customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures. This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.

<title>SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs. We release our code on the project page: https://mjalali.github.io/SPARKE

Abstract: In many nations, diabetes is becoming a significant health problem, and early identification and control are crucial. Using machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes has yielded encouraging results. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, this study attempts to evaluate the efficacy of several machine-learning methods for diabetes prediction. The collection includes information on 768 patients, such as their ages, BMIs, and glucose levels. The techniques assessed are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network. The findings indicate that the Neural Network algorithm performed the best, with an accuracy of 78.57 percent, followed by the Random Forest method, with an accuracy of 76.30 percent. The study implies that machine learning algorithms can aid diabetes prediction and be an efficient early detection tool.

Abstract: This study conducts an empirical examination of MLP networks investigated through a rigorous methodical experimentation process involving three diverse datasets: TinyFace, Heart Disease, and Iris. Study Overview: The study includes three key methods: a) a baseline training using the default settings for the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), b) feature selection using Genetic Algorithm (GA) based refinement c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based dimension reduction. The results show important information on how such techniques affect performance. While PCA had showed benefits in low-dimensional and noise-free datasets GA consistently increased accuracy in complex datasets by accurately identifying critical features. Comparison reveals that feature selection and dimensionality reduction play interdependent roles in enhancing MLP performance. The study contributes to the literature on feature engineering and neural network parameter optimization, offering practical guidelines for a wide range of machine learning tasks

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However, specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/skeletondyh/RADM

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

<title>Cross-Learning Between ECG and PCG: Exploring Common and Exclusive Characteristics of Bimodal Electromechanical Cardiac Waveforms</title>

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts. The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2) token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation. SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |), and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy). Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve unlearning knowledge.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and (4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks, experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy, where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions. Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling, inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making, such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of large language models to identify their decision patterns under various circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision making of large language models.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models. However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences, we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing consumption.

In this paper, we present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms, representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data, allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive. Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation. We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as significant in comparing relative system performance.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50 (ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM, deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen), uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions. This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries, including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality, especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings. We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and conditions.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions, highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content that causes student confusion.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges, including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings: specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks. However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP). Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is considered.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs, ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information. These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT (\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales. Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash welfare.

<title>Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization</title>

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32 pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization process.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest. Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation. Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation, avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality, multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings. Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

<title>Reliable Reasoning Path: Distilling Effective Guidance for LLM Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself. Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be released soon.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists. We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.

<title>Balancing Tails when Comparing Distributions: Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) with Application to Bias Evaluation in Operational Face Biometrics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets) confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals, precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive) error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails.

<title>TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However, these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1) an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and (4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model (LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples, constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for pedagogical feedback assessment.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP. It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.

<title>Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly available.

<title>Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study</title>

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models (LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1) identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem, in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such impact.

<title>Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning (MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in ranking metrics.

<title>PiPViT: Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes for Retinal Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging, where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels. Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations. Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of the map.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

Abstract: This paper is a brief introduction to our recently initiated project named VERIFAI: Traceability and verification of natural language requirements. The project addresses the challenges in the traceability and verification of formal specifications through providing support for the automatic generation of the formal specifications and the traceability of the requirements from the initial software design stage through the systems implementation and verification. Approaches explored in this project include Natural Language Processing, use of ontologies to describe the software system domain, reuse of existing software artefacts from similar systems (i.e. through similarity based reuse) and large language models to identify and declare the specifications as well as use of artificial intelligence to guide the process.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities, we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn, is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data. We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach, enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface defect detection.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy ($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by $69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.

<title>TED-LaST: Towards Robust Backdoor Defense Against Adaptive Attacks</title>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation, we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis. These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch, and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against evolving threats.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier, which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion (SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME) attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch (FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60, respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods, which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting. Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore, we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world models.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses for development and testing.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education, entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision. The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature, followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI, and clinical translation.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings. A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners' questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas: language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference, (ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to secure future adaptive DDLSs.

<title>Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting</title>

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the 4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

<title>Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast: The Three Golden Principles</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

<title>Precise Zero-Shot Pointwise Ranking with LLMs through Post-Aggregated Global Context Information</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores. We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions for future work in scale-aware model training.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input, the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline phases.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1) commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3) multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2) performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/duo

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets. Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative, quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are in Supp.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base (150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available at https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3, Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names, culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%, always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols, allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers, landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health, life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the "alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent, leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87% attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents. To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate, beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

<title>Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training</title>

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. \textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, \textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only $51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

<title>ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension. Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel, contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

<title>Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

<title>Principled Approaches for Extending Neural Architectures to Function Spaces for Operator Learning</title>

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs), are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance, neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g., physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing. Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications. This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at https://github.com/neuraloperator/NNs-to-NOs

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a common approach for Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in AI tasks. Embedding dimensions depend on application scenarios. Requiring a new dimension means training a new KGE model from scratch, increasing cost and limiting efficiency and flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel KGE training framework MED. It allows one training to obtain a croppable KGE model for multiple scenarios with different dimensional needs. Sub-models of required dimensions can be directly cropped and used without extra training. In MED, we propose a mutual learning mechanism to improve the low-dimensional sub-models and make high-dimensional sub-models retain the low-dimensional sub-models' capacity, an evolutionary improvement mechanism to promote the high-dimensional sub-models to master the triple that the low-dimensional sub-models can not, and a dynamic loss weight to adaptively balance the multiple losses. Experiments on 4 KGE models across 4 standard KG completion datasets, 3 real-world scenarios using a large-scale KG, and extending MED to the BERT language model demonstrate its effectiveness, high efficiency, and flexible extensibility.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods mainly rely on trial-and-error exploration, often lacking mechanisms to guide agents toward more informative decision-making and struggling to leverage past experiences, resulting in low sample efficiency. To overcome this issue, we propose an innovative framework inspired by cognitive principles: Cognitive Belief-Driven Reinforcement Learning (CBD-RL). By incorporating cognitive heuristics, CBD-RL transforms conventional trial-and-error learning into a more structured and guided learning paradigm, simulating the human reasoning process. This framework's core is a belief system that optimizes action probabilities by integrating feedback with prior experience, thus enhancing decision making under uncertainty. It also organizes state-action pairs into meaningful categories, promoting generalization and improving sample efficiency. The concrete implementations of this framework, CBDQ, CBDPPO, and CBDSAC, demonstrate superior performance in discrete and continuous action spaces in diverse environments such as Atari and MuJoCo. By bridging cognitive science and reinforcement learning, this research opens a new avenue for developing RL systems that are more interpretable, efficient, and cognitively inspired.

Abstract: We introduce Constrained Human-AI Cooperation (CHAIC), an inclusive embodied social intelligence challenge designed to test social perception and cooperation in embodied agents. In CHAIC, the goal is for an embodied agent equipped with egocentric observations to assist a human who may be operating under physical constraints -- e.g., unable to reach high places or confined to a wheelchair -- in performing common household or outdoor tasks as efficiently as possible. To achieve this, a successful helper must: (1) infer the human's intents and constraints by following the human and observing their behaviors (social perception), and (2) make a cooperative plan tailored to the human partner to solve the task as quickly as possible, working together as a team (cooperative planning). To benchmark this challenge, we create four new agents with real physical constraints and eight long-horizon tasks featuring both indoor and outdoor scenes with various constraints, emergency events, and potential risks. We benchmark planning- and learning-based baselines on the challenge and introduce a new method that leverages large language models and behavior modeling. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in enabling systematic assessment of key aspects of machine social intelligence. Our benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/UMass-Embodied-AGI/CHAIC.

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.

<title>Position: Theory of Mind Benchmarks are Broken for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained with next-turn rewards, limiting their ability to optimize for long-term interaction. As a result, they often respond passively to ambiguous or open-ended user requests, failing to help users reach their ultimate intents and leading to inefficient conversations. To address these limitations, we introduce CollabLLM, a novel and general training framework that enhances multiturn human-LLM collaboration. Its key innovation is a collaborative simulation that estimates the long-term contribution of responses using Multiturn-aware Rewards. By reinforcement fine-tuning these rewards, CollabLLM goes beyond responding to user requests, and actively uncovers user intent and offers insightful suggestions-a key step towards more human-centered AI. We also devise a multiturn interaction benchmark with three challenging tasks such as document creation. CollabLLM significantly outperforms our baselines with averages of 18.5% higher task performance and 46.3% improved interactivity by LLM judges. Finally, we conduct a large user study with 201 judges, where CollabLLM increases user satisfaction by 17.6% and reduces user spent time by 10.4%.

Abstract: There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.

<title>Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search</title>

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a major threat to vision systems by embedding localized perturbations that mislead deep models. Traditional defense methods often require retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for real-world deployment. We propose a training-free Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adversarial patch detection. By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model. Notably, the open-source UI-TARS-72B-DPO model achieves up to 95 percent classification accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source adversarial patch detection. Gemini-2.0 attains the highest overall accuracy, 98 percent, but remains closed-source. Experimental results demonstrate VRAG's effectiveness in identifying a variety of adversarial patches with minimal human annotation, paving the way for robust, practical defenses against evolving adversarial patch attacks.

Abstract: Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/minecraft-building-assistance-game.

<title>A Heuristic Algorithm Based on Beam Search and Iterated Local Search for the Maritime Inventory Routing Problem</title>

Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib, aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances. However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons, this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon, single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72 instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution for 19 instances within an acceptable CPU time.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark (CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: A packing $k$-coloring is a natural variation on the standard notion of graph $k$-coloring, where vertices are assigned numbers from $\{1, \ldots, k\}$, and any two vertices assigned a common color $c \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ need to be at a distance greater than $c$ (as opposed to $1$, in standard graph colorings). Despite a sequence of incremental work, determining the packing chromatic number of the infinite square grid has remained an open problem since its introduction in 2002. We culminate the search by proving this number to be 15. We achieve this result by improving the best-known method for this problem by roughly two orders of magnitude. The most important technique to boost performance is a novel and surprisingly effective propositional encoding. Additionally, we developed a new symmetry-breaking method. Since both new techniques are more complex than existing techniques for this problem, a verified approach is required to trust them. We include both techniques in a proof of unsatisfiability, reducing the trusted core to the correctness of the direct encoding.

Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is the algorithm we use to train neural networks. However, it remains poorly understood how the SGD navigates the highly nonlinear and degenerate loss landscape of a neural network. In this work, we show that the minibatch noise of SGD regularizes the solution towards a noise-balanced solution whenever the loss function contains a rescaling parameter symmetry. Because the difference between a simple diffusion process and SGD dynamics is the most significant when symmetries are present, our theory implies that the loss function symmetries constitute an essential probe of how SGD works. We then apply this result to derive the stationary distribution of stochastic gradient flow for a diagonal linear network with arbitrary depth and width. The stationary distribution exhibits complicated nonlinear phenomena such as phase transitions, broken ergodicity, and fluctuation inversion. These phenomena are shown to exist uniquely in deep networks, implying a fundamental difference between deep and shallow models.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs often suffer from incompleteness issues, which can be alleviated through information completion. However, current state-of-the-art deep knowledge convolutional embedding models rely on external convolution kernels and conventional convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model, ConvD, which directly reshapes relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels. This approach effectively enhances the feature interactions between relation embeddings and entity embeddings. Simultaneously, we incorporate a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism that assigns different contribution weight coefficients to the multiple relation convolution kernels in dynamic convolution, further boosting the expressive power of the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 3.28% to 14.69% across all model evaluation metrics, while the number of parameters is reduced by 50.66% to 85.40% compared to other state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Class imbalance severely impacts machine learning performance on minority classes in real-world applications. While various solutions exist, active learning offers a fundamental fix by strategically collecting balanced, informative labeled examples from abundant unlabeled data. We introduce DIRECT, an algorithm that identifies class separation boundaries and selects the most uncertain nearby examples for annotation. By reducing the problem to one-dimensional active learning, DIRECT leverages established theory to handle batch labeling and label noise -- another common challenge in data annotation that particularly affects active learning methods. Our work presents the first comprehensive study of active learning under both class imbalance and label noise. Extensive experiments on imbalanced datasets show DIRECT reduces annotation costs by over 60\% compared to state-of-the-art active learning methods and over 80\% versus random sampling, while maintaining robustness to label noise.

Abstract: Previous research on behavior-based attack detection for networks of IoT devices has resulted in machine learning models whose ability to adapt to unseen data is limited and often not demonstrated. This paper presents IoTGeM, an approach for modeling IoT network attacks that focuses on generalizability, yet also leads to better detection and performance. We first introduce an improved rolling window approach for feature extraction. To reduce overfitting, we then apply a multi-step feature selection process where a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is uniquely guided by exogenous feedback from a separate, independent dataset. To prevent common data leaks that have limited previous models, we build and test our models using strictly isolated train and test datasets. The resulting models are rigorously evaluated using a diverse portfolio of machine learning algorithms and datasets. Our window-based models demonstrate superior generalization compared to traditional flow-based models, particularly when tested on unseen datasets. On these stringent, cross-dataset tests, IoTGeM achieves F1 scores of 99\% for ACK, HTTP, SYN, MHD, and PS attacks, as well as a 94\% F1 score for UDP attacks. Finally, we build confidence in the models by using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainable AI technique, allowing us to identify the specific features that underlie the accurate detection of attacks.

Abstract: Center-based clustering has attracted significant research interest from both theory and practice. In many practical applications, input data often contain background knowledge that can be used to improve clustering results. In this work, we build on widely adopted $k$-center clustering and model its input background knowledge as must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraint sets. However, most clustering problems including $k$-center are inherently $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, while the more complex constrained variants are known to suffer severer approximation and computation barriers that significantly limit their applicability. By employing a suite of techniques including reverse dominating sets, linear programming (LP) integral polyhedron, and LP duality, we arrive at the first efficient approximation algorithm for constrained $k$-center with the best possible ratio of 2. We also construct competitive baseline algorithms and empirically evaluate our approximation algorithm against them on a variety of real datasets. The results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the great advantages of our algorithm in terms of clustering cost, clustering quality, and running time.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations. We release our code at https://github.com/Linxi-ZHAO/MARINE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Their impact extends across a diverse spectrum of tasks, revolutionizing how we approach language understanding and generations. Nevertheless, alongside their remarkable utility, LLMs introduce critical security and risk considerations. These challenges warrant careful examination to ensure responsible deployment and safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. This research paper thoroughly investigates security and privacy concerns related to LLMs from five thematic perspectives: security and privacy concerns, vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, potential harms caused by misuses of LLMs, mitigation strategies to address these challenges while identifying limitations of current strategies. Lastly, the paper recommends promising avenues for future research to enhance the security and risk management of LLMs.

<title>Visually Descriptive Language Model for Vector Graphics Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

<title>Incentivizing Quality Text Generation via Statistical Contracts</title>

Abstract: While the success of large language models (LLMs) increases demand for machine-generated text, current pay-per-token pricing schemes create a misalignment of incentives known in economics as moral hazard: Text-generating agents have strong incentive to cut costs by preferring a cheaper model over the cutting-edge one, and this can be done "behind the scenes" since the agent performs inference internally. In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality. We study a principal-agent game where the agent generates text using costly inference, and the contract determines the principal's payment for the text according to an automated quality evaluation. Since standard contract theory is inapplicable when internal inference costs are unknown, we introduce cost-robust contracts. As our main theoretical contribution, we characterize optimal cost-robust contracts through a direct correspondence to optimal composite hypothesis tests from statistics, generalizing a result of Saig et al. (NeurIPS'23). We evaluate our framework empirically by deriving contracts for a range of objectives and LLM evaluation benchmarks, and find that cost-robust contracts sacrifice only a marginal increase in objective value compared to their cost-aware counterparts.

Abstract: Hate speech poses a significant threat to social harmony. Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of the large language model, gpt-3.5-turbo. However, we also caution that an overemphasis on demographic information can negatively impact the fine-tuned model performance due to data fragmentation.

<title>Privacy-Aware Spectrum Pricing and Power Control Optimization for LEO Satellite Internet-of-Things</title>

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems play an important role in next generation communication networks due to their ability to provide extensive global coverage with guaranteed communications in remote areas and isolated areas where base stations cannot be cost-efficiently deployed. With the pervasive adoption of LEO satellite systems, especially in the LEO Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios, their spectrum resource management requirements have become more complex as a result of massive service requests and high bandwidth demand from terrestrial terminals. For instance, when leasing the spectrum to terrestrial users and controlling the uplink transmit power, satellites collect user data for machine learning purposes, which usually are sensitive information such as location, budget and quality of service (QoS) requirement. To facilitate model training in LEO IoT while preserving the privacy of data, blockchain-driven federated learning (FL) is widely used by leveraging on a fully decentralized architecture. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spectrum pricing and power control framework for LEO IoT by combining blockchain technology and FL. We first design a local deep reinforcement learning algorithm for LEO satellite systems to learn a revenue-maximizing pricing and power control scheme. Then the agents collaborate to form a FL system. We also propose a reputation-based blockchain which is used in the global model aggregation phase of FL. Based on the reputation mechanism, a node is selected for each global training round to perform model aggregation and block generation, which can further enhance the decentralization of the network and guarantee the trust. Simulation tests are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme. Our results show the efficiency of finding the maximum revenue scheme for LEO satellite systems while preserving the privacy of each agent.

Abstract: Growing concerns over the theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) have heightened the need for effective fingerprinting, which links a model to its original version to detect misuse. In this paper, we define five key properties for a successful fingerprint: Transparency, Efficiency, Persistence, Robustness, and Unforgeability. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that provides verifiable proof of ownership while maintaining fingerprint integrity. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we propose a Chain and Hash technique that cryptographically binds fingerprint prompts with their responses, ensuring no adversary can generate colliding fingerprints and allowing model owners to irrefutably demonstrate their creation. Second, we address a realistic threat model in which instruction-tuned models' output distribution can be significantly altered through meta-prompts. By integrating random padding and varied meta-prompt configurations during training, our method preserves fingerprint robustness even when the model's output style is significantly modified. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework offers strong security for proving ownership and remains resilient against benign transformations like fine-tuning, as well as adversarial attempts to erase fingerprints. Finally, we also demonstrate its applicability to fingerprinting LoRA adapters.

<title>Multi-group Uncertainty Quantification for Long-form Text Generation</title>

arXiv:2407.21057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While past works have shown how uncertainty quantification can be applied to large language model (LLM) outputs, the question of whether resulting uncertainty guarantees still hold within sub-groupings of data remains open. In our work, given some long-form text generated by an LLM, we study uncertainty at both the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Using biography generation as a testbed for this study, we derive a set of (demographic) attributes (e.g., whether some text describes a man or woman) for each generation to form such "subgroups" of data. We find that although canonical methods for both types of uncertainty quantification perform well when measuring across the entire dataset, such guarantees break down when examining particular subgroups. Having established this issue, we invoke group-conditional methods for uncertainty quantification -- multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction -- and find that across a variety of approaches, additional subgroup information consistently improves calibration and conformal prediction within subgroups (while crucially retaining guarantees across the entire dataset). As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these results to form a benchmark for this setting.

<title>TimeBridge: Better Diffusion Prior Design with Bridge Models for Time Series Generation</title>

Abstract: Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis testing. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach to time series generation, enabling diverse synthesis scenarios. However, the fixed standard-Gaussian diffusion prior may be ill-suited for general time series data, such as temporal order and fixed points. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that flexibly synthesizes time series data by using diffusion bridges to learn paths between a chosen prior and the data distribution. We then explore several prior designs tailored to time series synthesis. Our framework covers (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional generation and (ii) scale-preserving priors for conditional generation. Experiments show that our framework with data-driven priors outperforms standard diffusion models on time series generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-model workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

Abstract: Detecting issue framing in text - how different perspectives approach the same topic - is valuable for social science and policy analysis, yet challenging for automated methods due to subtle linguistic differences. We introduce `paired completion', a novel approach using LLM next-token log probabilities to detect contrasting frames using minimal examples. Through extensive evaluation across synthetic datasets and a human-labeled corpus, we demonstrate that paired completion is a cost-efficient, low-bias alternative to both prompt-based and embedding-based methods, offering a scalable solution for analyzing issue framing in large text collections, especially suited to low-resource settings.

<title>M3-JEPA: Multimodal Alignment via Multi-gate MoE based on the Joint-Predictive Embedding Architecture</title>

arXiv:2409.05929v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current multimodal learning strategies primarily optimize in the original token space. Such a framework is easy to incorporate with the backbone of pretrained language model, but might result in modality collapse. To alleviate such issues, we leverage the joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) on the multimodal tasks, which converts the input embedding into the output embedding space by a predictor and then conducts the cross-modal alignment on the latent space. We implement this predictor by a Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) and name the framework as M3-JEPA, accordingly. The gating function disentangles the modality-specific and shared information and derives information-theoretic optimality. The framework is implemented with both contrastive and regularization loss, and solved by alternative gradient descent (AGD) between different multimodal tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-JEPA can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in both training and inference. Our observation suggests that M3-JEPA might become a new basis to self-supervised learning in the open world.

Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.

<title>Center-fixing of tropical cyclones using uncertainty-aware deep learning applied to high-temporal-resolution geostationary satellite imagery</title>

Abstract: Determining the location of a tropical cyclone's (TC) surface circulation center -- "center-fixing" -- is a critical first step in the TC-forecasting process, affecting current/future estimates of track, intensity, and structure. Despite a recent increase in automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are often unavailable. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the operational Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System, it relies only on geostationary infrared (IR) satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 9 channels at lag times up to 4 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for tropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors with microwave or scatterometer data, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification, producing a well calibrated ensemble of 150 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10 min.

Abstract: Despite the success of Transformers, handling long contexts remains challenging due to the limited length generalization and quadratic complexity of self-attention. Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger attention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context, Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the pre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant information with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past chunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works that use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates retrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range information access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs during training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve near-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is 1000 times the training length.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed them from basic conversational tools into sophisticated entities capable of complex reasoning and decision-making. These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.

Abstract: The principles of automation and innovation serve as foundational elements for advancement in contemporary science and technology. Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant persuasive capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges, remains underexplored. This paper addresses the research question: \emph{Can LLMs generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?}
  To answer this, we propose a pipeline using reinforcement learning with simulated feedback, where the network's response to LLM-generated content (i.e., the reward) is simulated through a formal engagement model. This approach bypasses the temporal cost and complexity of live experiments, enabling an efficient feedback loop between the LLM and the network under study. It also allows to control over endogenous factors such as the LLM's position within the social network and the distribution of opinions on a given topic. Our approach is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. Such flexibility makes it suitable for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.
  Using our framework, we analyze the performance of LLMs in generating social engagement under different conditions, showcasing their full potential in this task. The experimental code is publicly available at https://github.com/mminici/Engagement-Driven-Content-Generation.

Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In particular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the agents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training framework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed execution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method when using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the network throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing the overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and collision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism in the saturated traffic scenario. Furthermore, the QPMIX algorithm is robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive traffic scenarios. It coexists well with the conventional CSMA/CA mechanism and promotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.

<title>SR-Reward: Taking The Path More Traveled</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.

<title>Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors</title>

Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.

<title>Upweighting Easy Samples in Fine-Tuning Mitigates Forgetting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02797</link>

Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a downstream task often degrades its original capabilities, a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". This is especially an issue when one does not have access to the data and recipe used to develop the pre-trained model. Under this constraint, most existing methods for mitigating forgetting are inapplicable. To address this challenge, we propose a sample weighting scheme for the fine-tuning data solely based on the pre-trained model's losses. Specifically, we upweight the easy samples on which the pre-trained model's loss is low and vice versa to limit the drift from the pre-trained model. Our approach is orthogonal and yet complementary to existing methods; while such methods mostly operate on parameter or gradient space, we concentrate on the sample space. We theoretically analyze the impact of fine-tuning with our method in a linear setting, showing that it stalls learning in a certain subspace which inhibits overfitting to the target task. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method on both language and vision tasks. As an example, when fine-tuning Gemma 2 2B on MetaMathQA, our method results in only a $0.8\%$ drop in accuracy on GSM8K (another math dataset) compared to standard fine-tuning, while preserving $5.4\%$ more accuracy on the pre-training datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/FLOW_finetuning .

Abstract: As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as ''AI Oversight''. We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing Chance Adjusted Probabilistic Agreement (CAPA): a metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using CAPA, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from ''weak-to-strong generalization''. As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.

<title>Prompt-based Depth Pruning of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.04348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of a large language model without any hardware-specific complications, by simply removing several less important transformer blocks. However, our empirical findings suggest that the importance of a transformer block may be highly task-dependent -- a block that is crucial for a task can be removed without degrading the accuracy on another task. Based on this observation, we develop a dynamic depth pruning algorithm, coined PuDDing (Prompt-routed Dynamic Depth Pruning), which determines which blocks to omit from the model based on the input prompt. PuDDing operates by training a lightweight router to predict the best omission set among a set of options, where this option set has also been constructed in a data-driven manner. Empirical results on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PuDDing effectively accelerates the inference language models, and achieves better on-task performance than static depth pruning baselines.

<title>Implicit Language Models are RNNs: Balancing Parallelization and Expressivity</title>

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) and transformers dominate the language modeling landscape. However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/microsoft/implicit_languagemodels .

arXiv:2502.07864v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present TransMLA, a framework that seamlessly converts any GQA-based pre-trained model into an MLA-based model. Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.

Abstract: In an era overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, the effective curation of web-crawl datasets is essential for optimizing model performance. This paper tackles the challenges associated with the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of such datasets. Traditional heuristic curation methods often inadequately capture complex features, resulting in biases and the exclusion of relevant data. We introduce an advanced, learning-driven approach, Ensemble Curation Of DAta ThroUgh Multimodal Operators (EcoDatum), incorporating a novel quality-guided deduplication method to ensure balanced feature distributions. EcoDatum strategically integrates various unimodal and multimodal data curation operators within a weak supervision ensemble framework, utilizing automated optimization to score each data point effectively. EcoDatum, which significantly improves the data curation quality and efficiency, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, ranked 1st on the DataComp leaderboard, with an average performance score of 0.182 across 38 diverse evaluation datasets. This represents a 28% improvement over the DataComp baseline method, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving dataset curation and model training efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).

Abstract: Feature interaction is crucial in predictive machine learning models, as it captures the relationships between features that influence model performance. In this work, we focus on pairwise interactions and investigate their importance in constructing feature graphs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We leverage existing GNN models and tools to explore the relationship between feature graph structures and their effectiveness in modeling interactions. Through experiments on synthesized datasets, we uncover that edges between interacting features are important for enabling GNNs to model feature interactions effectively. We also observe that including non-interaction edges can act as noise, degrading model performance. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support for sparse feature graph selection using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We prove that feature graphs retaining only necessary interaction edges yield a more efficient and interpretable representation than complete graphs, aligning with Occam's Razor. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing feature graphs that improve the performance and interpretability of GNN models.

Abstract: Recent copyright agreements between AI companies and content creators underscore the need for fine-grained control over language models' ability to reproduce copyrighted text. Existing defenses-ranging from aggressive unlearning to simplistic output filters-either sacrifice model utility or inadequately address verbatim leakage. We introduce Obliviate, a lightweight post-training method that surgically suppresses exact reproduction of specified sequences while preserving semantic understanding. Obliviate first identifies memorized passages and then, for each target token, minimally adjusts the model's output distribution via a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to drive down the probability of exact reproduction. Simultaneously, we enforce a consistency loss on non-target tokens to retain the model's fluency and task performance. We evaluate Obliviate on four popular 6-8B-parameter models (LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.1-Instruct, Qwen-2.5, and Yi-1.5) using synthetic memorization benchmarks and organic copyrighted excerpts (e.g., Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and Les Miserables). Across all settings, Obliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude (e.g., from hundreds of words to fewer than 12) while degrading downstream accuracy by at most 1% on HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande. Furthermore, we benchmark Obliviate aganist different unlearning and copyright techniques using the MUSE and CoTaEval benchmarks. These results position Obliviate as a practical, high-fidelity solution for copyright compliance in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54% on EGONORMIA and 65% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently driven significant breakthroughs in generative modeling. While state-of-the-art models produce high-quality samples on average, individual samples can still be low quality. Detecting such samples without human inspection remains a challenging task. To address this, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimating generative uncertainty of synthetic samples. We outline how to make Bayesian inference practical for large, modern generative models and introduce a new semantic likelihood (evaluated in the latent space of a feature extractor) to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional sample spaces. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed generative uncertainty effectively identifies poor-quality samples and significantly outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods. Notably, our Bayesian framework can be applied post-hoc to any pretrained diffusion or flow matching model (via the Laplace approximation), and we propose simple yet effective techniques to minimize its computational overhead during sampling.

Abstract: The Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP) entails finding the subset of observation targets to be scheduled along the satellite's orbit while meeting operational constraints of time, energy and memory. The problem of deciding what and when to observe is inherently complex, and becomes even more challenging when considering several issues that compromise the quality of the captured images, such as cloud occlusion, atmospheric turbulence, and image resolution. This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for addressing the AEOSSP with time-dependent profits, integrating these three factors to optimize the use of energy and memory resources. The proposed method involves a dual decision-making process: selecting the sequence of targets and determining the optimal observation time for each. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the capture of images that fail to meet quality requirements by > 60% and consequently decreases energy waste from attitude maneuvers by up to 78%, all while maintaining strong observation performance.

We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly adopted in various academic and commercial applications due to its real-time and high-quality rendering capabilities, emphasizing the growing need for copyright protection technologies for 3DGS. However, the large model size of 3DGS requires developing efficient compression techniques. This highlights the necessity of an integrated framework that addresses copyright protection and data compression for 3D content. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS watermarking methods significantly degrade watermark performance under 3DGS compression methods, particularly quantization-based approaches that achieve superior compression performance. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant anchor-based 3DGS watermarking, which preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. This is achieved by introducing anchor-based 3DGS watermarking. We embed the watermark into the anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that improves rendering quality and watermark performance by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.

Abstract: Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.

<title>Expert Race: A Flexible Routing Strategy for Scaling Diffusion Transformer with Mixture of Experts</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as mainstream framework in visual generation. Building upon this success, the integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods has shown promise in enhancing model scalability and performance. In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant performance gains while promising scaling properties.

<title>On the Geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Curves</title>

Abstract: We study the geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves in binary classification problems. The key finding is that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely functions of the composition function $G := F_p \circ F_n^{-1}$, where $F_p(\cdot)$ and $F_n(\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution functions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes, respectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating points, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between classifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves reflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers optimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We further explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and numerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance on ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative class leakage function $G(\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The framework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration, cost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world capacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier deployment and decision-making.

<title>A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.

<title>Elucidating the Design Space of Multimodal Protein Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal protein language models (PLMs) integrate sequence and token-based structural information, serving as a powerful foundation for protein modeling, generation, and design. However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.

<title>MAYA: Addressing Inconsistencies in Generative Password Guessing through a Unified Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to their application in password guessing, with the aim of replicating the complexity, structure, and patterns of human-created passwords. Despite their potential, inconsistencies and inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered meaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their capabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic characterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the context of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets and covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over 15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions learned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark generative password-guessing models. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking.

<title>Token-Efficient RL for LLM Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2504.20834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

<title>The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems</title>

<div> Keywords: AI alignment, ethical entropy, thermodynamics, Fisher Information Matrix, gradient-based optimizers<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The paper proposes an analogy between artificial intelligence systems and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, introducing "ethical entropy" as a measure of an AI system's divergence from its intended goals.  <br>2. Ethical entropy is mathematically defined over a finite goal set using the formula \( S = -\sum p(g_i; \theta) \ln p(g_i; \theta) \), where \( p(g_i; \theta) \) represents the probability distribution over goals parameterized by \(\theta\).  <br>3. It is proven that the time derivative of ethical entropy, \( dS/dt \), is non-negative, implying that entropy naturally increases due to factors like exploration noise and specification gaming in unconstrained AI systems.  <br>4. The paper derives a critical stability boundary for alignment work needed to prevent entropy increase, defined as \(\gamma_{\text{crit}} = (\lambda_{\max}/2) \ln N\), where \(\lambda_{\max}\) is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and \(N\) is the number of model parameters.  <br>5. Simulations with a 7-billion-parameter model validate the theory, showing that without sufficient alignment work, entropy increases significantly, whereas applying alignment regularization above the critical boundary maintains system stability at near-zero entropy. <br>6. This work reframes AI alignment as a continuous thermodynamic control problem, providing a quantitative framework for ensuring the long-term stability and safety of autonomous AI systems. <div>

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -{\Sigma} p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

<title>Co-EPG: A Framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding in Autonomous GUI Agents</title>

<div> GUI automation, planning, grounding, self-iterative training, Co-EPG<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses challenges in GUI task automation by proposing Co-EPG, a novel self-iterative training framework that enables the co-evolution of planning and grounding models. The current approaches face two main issues: limited integration of cross-model synergies and an over-reliance on synthetic data without fully leveraging it. Co-EPG introduces an iterative positive feedback loop where the planning model improves by exploring better strategies under the guidance of rewards derived from the grounding model, using a method called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This process generates diverse data to refine the grounding model. In turn, the optimized grounding model provides enhanced rewards that further improve the planning model during subsequent GRPO training cycles. This cyclical interaction fosters continuous self-improvement through self-play optimization and data distillation. Evaluations on the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks show that Co-EPG surpasses state-of-the-art methods after only three iterations, without relying on external data sources. The framework demonstrates consistent progression in agent performance with each iteration, marking a shift from isolated model optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution paradigm for GUI agents. <div>
arXiv:2511.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

<div> Graph theory, clique-width, SAT encoding, abstract argumentation, computational complexity

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper explores the relationship between structural graph parameters and their impact on computational complexity, focusing on the less-studied parameter clique-width. While treewidth has been extensively used to design efficient algorithms and SAT encodings, clique-width offers advantages for dense graphs but lacks well-understood encoding techniques. The authors focus on abstract argumentation, a framework based on directed graphs that models reasoning with conflicting arguments, known for its computational challenges. They develop novel reductions from argumentation problems to SAT and QSAT formulations that preserve clique-width linearly through directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. These reductions are applicable to all argumentation semantics, including problems involving counting extensions, thereby broadening the scope of efficient SAT-based reasoning in argumentation. Importantly, the authors prove that the overhead introduced by their DDG reductions is essentially optimal under reasonable complexity assumptions, meaning significant improvements are unlikely. This work initiates a deeper understanding of how clique-width can guide compact and efficient SAT encodings, bridging gaps between graph structural measures, argumentation theory, and practical solver efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2511.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

<div> Keywords: counterfactual decision-making, potential outcome ranking, probability of best outcome, identification theorems, estimation methods<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenge of making optimal decisions under uncertainty by leveraging causal reasoning to evaluate potential outcomes of different actions. It introduces two novel metrics: the Probability of Potential outcome Ranking (PoR), which identifies the most likely order of outcomes for an individual, and the Probability of achieving the Best outcome (PoB), which determines the action most likely to produce the highest-ranked outcome for that individual. The authors develop theoretical results by proving identification theorems that allow these metrics to be inferred from observed data, and they formulate bounds that constrain their possible values. To operationalize these concepts, the paper outlines estimation techniques for both PoR and PoB. Finally, the methodology is validated through numerical experiments that explore estimator behavior in finite samples and demonstrate practical utility through a real-world dataset application. Overall, this work advances counterfactual decision-making by quantifying individual-level outcome rankings and highlighting actions with the greatest probability of yielding optimal results. <div>
arXiv:2511.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

<div> Keywords: adaptive reasoning, large language models, policy optimization, training-based approaches, self-evaluation  

<br><br>Summary:  
This survey addresses the challenge of adaptivity in reasoning for large language models (LLMs), highlighting that current models often use uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity. First, it formalizes three classical reasoning types—deductive, inductive, and abductive—within the context of LLMs, linking traditional cognitive paradigms to their algorithmic forms. Second, it conceptualizes adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem, which balances task performance against computational cost, differentiating between learned policies and inference-time controls. Third, the paper proposes a taxonomy categorizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, as well as training-free approaches that rely on prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. By organizing these diverse strategies under a unified framework, the survey clarifies their operational mechanisms and facilitates systematic comparisons. Finally, it identifies open challenges for future research, including improving self-evaluation, enhancing meta-reasoning capabilities, and developing human-aligned reasoning control to better tailor LLM outputs. <div>
arXiv:2511.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

<div> Hazard Prediction, Human-Agent Collaboration, Large Language Models, Risk Analysis, Operational Safety<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper introduces HARNESS, a modular AI framework aimed at improving operational safety at mission-critical work sites within U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS forecasts hazardous events and analyzes operational risks by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data and historical event retrieval. A key feature of the system is its human-in-the-loop mechanism, which allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine and validate the model’s predictions, creating an adaptive feedback loop that enhances system accuracy and responsiveness over time. The collaboration between SMEs and the AI agents enables iterative, agentic reasoning, leading to increased reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployments of HARNESS have demonstrated promising results in anticipating hazards and mitigating risks. Future research efforts will focus on quantitatively evaluating the system’s prediction accuracy, measuring SME agreement levels on forecasts, and reducing decision latency to improve real-time response capabilities. Overall, HARNESS represents a significant step toward integrating AI with expert knowledge for proactive safety management in hazardous operational environments. <div>

Abstract: Operational safety at mission-critical work sites is a top priority given the complex and hazardous nature of daily tasks. This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.

<div> Keywords: knowledge graphs, embedding methods, HyperComplEx, multi-space modeling, scalable training

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the limitations of existing knowledge graph embedding methods, which struggle when modeling diverse relationship types at scale. Traditional Euclidean models have difficulties with hierarchical data, vector space models fail to capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models are challenged by symmetric relations. To overcome these issues, the authors propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that integrates hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces through learned attention mechanisms. The model incorporates a relation-specific space weighting strategy that dynamically selects the optimal geometry for each relation, improving representational flexibility. A multi-space consistency loss is introduced to ensure coherent predictions across the different embedding spaces. HyperComplEx is evaluated on large-scale computer science knowledge graphs, ranging from 1,000 to 10 million papers and up to 45 million triples, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines such as TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Notably, on the largest dataset, it achieves a 0.612 MRR with a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline while maintaining efficient training and inference (85 ms per triple). The approach also scales near-linearly as graph size increases due to adaptive dimension allocation. The authors provide their implementation and datasets to support reproducibility and further research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

<div> Keywords: traffic collision reconstruction, multi-agent AI, multimodal data, Event Data Recorder, crash reasoning<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This study presents a novel multi-agent AI framework designed to reconstruct pre-crash scenarios and infer vehicle behaviors from incomplete and multimodal collision data. The framework operates in two collaborative phases: Phase I generates natural-language reconstructions from textual, tabular, and visual crash inputs, while Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by integrating these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR) data. The system was applied to 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, focusing specifically on 39 complex cases involving ambiguous or conflicting EDR records. Validation results showed that the framework achieved perfect accuracy in identifying relevant EDR events and accurately distinguishing between striking and struck vehicles, outperforming human researchers who attained 92% accuracy on the same dataset. Notably, the AI maintained robust performance despite incomplete or erroneous data inputs, including missing EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This research demonstrates the superior capability of AI in processing heterogeneous and fragmented collision data, offering unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and accurately characterizing pre-crash vehicle behaviors for enhanced traffic collision analysis. <div>

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

<div> Planning units, agentic AI, spatial self-organizing map, disaster planning, flooding risk<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This article addresses the limitations of conventional planning units such as census tracts and zip codes, which often fail to meet the specific demands of local communities for hazard prevention and disaster response. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce a planning support system that incorporates agentic AI to create dynamic, demand-oriented planning regions. The system is designed around a novel method called the representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), which enhances traditional self-organizing maps through adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement techniques. This framework allows AI agents to actively participate by reasoning, planning, and guiding users in selecting input features, applying spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. Importantly, the system emphasizes a human-in-the-loop approach to maintain transparency and adaptability, promoting user-driven decision-making in the regionalization process. The effectiveness of the platform is demonstrated through a case study focused on flooding risk management in Jacksonville, Florida. This practical example highlights how the system enables users to interactively generate, explore, and assess new planning regions that better correspond to local hazard risks and community needs, thereby combining computational rigor with practical, user-centered disaster planning solutions. <div>

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

arXiv:2511.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

<div> Legal compliance, AI-driven data transfer, multi-agent system, Japanese APPI, automated verification<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the growing importance of legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning, particularly under strict privacy regulations like Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). The authors propose a novel multi-agent legal verifier system that divides compliance checking into specialized agents focusing on statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment. These agents work together through a structured synthesis protocol to provide coordinated reasoning. The approach was evaluated on a carefully stratified dataset containing 200 cases related to Amended APPI Article 16, each with clearly defined ground truth labels. Performance was measured using multiple metrics, where the multi-agent system achieved an overall accuracy of 72%, substantially outperforming a single-agent baseline by 21 percentage points. Notably, the system demonstrated 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases compared to the baseline’s 16%, while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. Despite challenges in ambiguous cases, the results highlight that domain specialization combined with coordinated reasoning significantly enhances the effectiveness of legal AI systems. This work offers a scalable, regulation-aware framework that supports trustworthy and interpretable automated verification of legal compliance in data transfer scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

<div> Keywords: autonomous AI, decision making, operational constraints, normative understanding, aligned behavior<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges faced by deployed autonomous AI systems when they encounter novel or under-specified contexts in which no single course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints such as rules, laws, and goals. It emphasizes the importance of going beyond pre-trained policies by constructing, evaluating, and justifying multiple candidate courses of action. A central requirement for effective decision making in these situations is access to contextual knowledge that may not have been acquired during initial training. The authors characterize the types of knowledge necessary for robust decision making that aligns AI behavior with human expectations and values. By combining normative (ethical and rule-based), pragmatic (practical and goal-oriented), and situational understanding, agents can better assess and select appropriate courses of action in complex real-world scenarios. The paper supports its claims with both theoretical analysis and empirical case studies, illustrating how integrated knowledge improves alignment and robustness in AI decision making. Overall, it contributes to the design principles necessary for autonomous agents to perform reliably and ethically when facing ambiguous or conflicting operational demands. <div>

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, Ontology, Automated Extraction, E-commerce

<br><br>Summary: This paper presents a novel, fully automated framework for constructing product knowledge graphs (KGs) directly from unstructured e-commerce product descriptions, addressing the challenges of organizing vast and complex product data. The method leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an AI agent-driven approach that operates in three stages: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. Unlike traditional methods, this approach does not rely on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules, enhancing scalability and semantic coherence. The framework has been tested on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, achieving impressive results with over 97% property coverage and minimal redundancy. The evaluation demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in generating high-quality ontologies and populating KGs accurately. This work underscores the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction processes in the retail domain, enabling intelligent data integration and utilization. Ultimately, the framework provides a scalable, efficient solution for e-commerce platforms to transform unstructured product data into interpretable and actionable knowledge graphs, facilitating improved information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. <div>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

<title>Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures</title>

<div> Keywords: constraint programming, symmetry breaking, abstract structures, modelling languages, indistinguishable objects  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of symmetry breaking in constraint programming when dealing with abstract structures like nested sets, which are not natively supported by solvers and must be transformed into other representations such as matrices. Symmetry breaking is essential to reduce redundant search on symmetric solutions, thus significantly speeding up the solving process. Traditional symmetry-breaking methods impose orderings on problem variables to select a canonical representative solution, often the smallest, but these methods become impractical and inefficient when applied directly to abstract variables due to the resulting large and complex constraints. The authors propose a novel, incomplete method that exploits the underlying representations of these abstract structures more effectively to break symmetries, specifically focusing on those arising from indistinguishable objects—a common and important symmetry type. The new approach improves performance and scalability compared to previous methods, such as those introduced by Akgün et al. (2025), by reducing the complexity and size of constraints needed for symmetry breaking. This advancement suggests a promising direction for modeling languages and solvers in tackling symmetry-related inefficiencies in abstract structure constraint problems. <div>
arXiv:2511.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\"un et al. 2025).

<div> Multi-Agent Debate, Role Allocation, Truth Last, Consistency, Reasoning Tasks<br><br>Summary:<br><br> This study investigates the impact of role allocation strategies within Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks on the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It identifies that assigning distinct viewpoints to specific roles crucially influences MAD performance in reasoning tasks. One key contribution is the introduction of a novel role allocation strategy called "Truth Last," which improves reasoning accuracy by up to 22%. Addressing the challenge of uncertain truth in practical contexts, the researchers propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy. MADC systematically simulates and optimizes core mechanisms using path consistency to evaluate agreement among independent agent roles, designating the role with the highest consistency score as representing the truth. The approach was empirically validated on nine different LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 distilled models, across difficult reasoning tasks. Results show that MADC consistently outperforms baseline MAD strategies, effectively breaking through prior performance bottlenecks. This work offers a vital advancement toward enhancing the scalability and reasoning performance of LLM agents by refining role assignment and consensus mechanisms within multi-agent debates. <div>

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

<div> Planning, differentiable simulation, autonomous driving, gradient descent, path planning<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper presents Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a novel framework designed to improve planning in autonomous driving scenarios. Planning is essential for safely refining actions before execution in complex and dense traffic environments, helping to avoid collisions. DSS leverages a differentiable simulator called Waymax, which serves dual roles as both a next-state predictor and a critic within the planning process. Unlike traditional learned models, Waymax’s hardcoded dynamics enable highly accurate state predictions. The differentiability of the simulator allows the DSS agent to optimize action sequences using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories, effectively searching through possible actions. This contrasts with methods relying solely on policy learning, sequence prediction, or model-free reinforcement learning. Experimentally, DSS demonstrates significant improvements in tracking accuracy and path planning compared to previous approaches including imitation learning and stochastic search alone. By combining gradient-based optimization with stochastic search, DSS offers a powerful planning strategy that harnesses accurate simulation dynamics to better anticipate future states and outcomes. This approach is particularly suited to the challenges of autonomous driving, where precise and reliable planning under uncertainty is critical for safety and performance. <div>

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

<br><br>Summary:  
1. The paper introduces ARCTraj, a novel dataset and methodological framework designed to model human reasoning during complex visual tasks within the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC).  
2. Unlike existing approaches that depend solely on static input-output pairs, ARCTraj records temporally ordered, object-level actions, allowing insight into intermediate reasoning steps and how human reasoning evolves over time.

4. ARCTraj defines a unified reasoning pipeline that covers data collection, action abstraction, formulation as a Markov decision process (MDP), and supports integration with advanced downstream techniques such as reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO), generative models (World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents), and sequence modeling (Decision Transformers).  
5. Through analysis of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence, the work reveals key structural aspects and diversity in human reasoning, positioning ARCTraj as a foundational resource to enhance explainability, alignment, and development of more generalizable, human-like intelligence models. <div>

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

<div> Generalised planning, goal regression, first-order rules, state space pruning, optimal plans<br><br>Summary:  
The paper introduces a novel and straightforward approach to generalised planning (GP), which is the process of synthesising programs capable of solving families of related planning problems. The method begins by taking a set of training problems and for each problem computing an optimal plan for each goal atom in a specified order. Then, goal regression is applied to these plans to derive corresponding outputs that are lifted into first-order “Condition → Actions” rules. These rules together form a generalised plan that can either be executed directly or used to prune the search space in planning tasks. The authors formalise the theoretical framework and define the specific conditions under which their method guarantees the validity of the generalised plans produced, along with axioms related to state space pruning in search algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach yields significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art generalised planners. Improvements are measured across three key criteria: synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality. The evaluation incorporates a variety of classical and numeric planning domains, illustrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of the method in enhancing planning efficiency and performance. <div>

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

<div> Keywords: Unified Multimodal Models, generative reasoning, geometric construction, benchmark, GGBench<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The paper introduces the concept of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which represent a significant shift in AI by enabling active cross-modal generation instead of mere passive perception. Despite UMMs' advanced capabilities in synthesizing information, existing evaluation methods fall short as they usually focus separately on either discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation, without addressing their combined reasoning ability. To address this gap, the authors propose geometric construction as an ideal domain to test integrated generative reasoning because it inherently requires the fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. They present GGBench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model’s capacity for geometric generative reasoning. GGBench offers a structured framework that allows systematic diagnosis of a model's skills in understanding, reasoning, and actively generating constructive solutions. By integrating language understanding and visual generation evaluation, this benchmark sets a more rigorous standard for assessing next-generation intelligent systems and promotes research aimed at deeper cognitive abilities in AI. The project website provides access to the benchmark and additional resources. <div>

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

<div> hallucination, multi-agent debate, multimodal reasoning, counterfactual testing, large language models<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the persistent issue of hallucination in large language models (LLMs) that hampers their reasoning accuracy. It critiques the existing Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm for assuming all debaters are rational and reflective, which is unrealistic when agents may hallucinate themselves. To overcome this, the authors propose the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games such as "Who is Undercover?". MUG innovatively recasts the problem as detecting hallucinating "undercover" agents using multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, it modifies reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and checks if agents can detect these alterations accurately, thus providing ground-truth identification of hallucinating agents. The approach advances MAD in three major ways: (1) enabling factual verification beyond mere statistical consensus by applying counterfactual testing, (2) facilitating cross-evidence reasoning through dynamically modified evidence rather than static inputs, and (3) promoting active reasoning where agents engage in probing discussions instead of passively responding. Overall, MUG offers a more dependable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The authors have made the source code publicly available at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git. <div>

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

<div> Table reasoning, large language models, slow-thinking, reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses key limitations in table reasoning using large language models (LLMs), focusing on improving the depth and stability of the reasoning process. The authors introduce STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a novel framework that equips LLMs with slow-thinking capabilities by modeling step-by-step reasoning and incorporating uncertainty-aware inference. STaR uses a two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL) approach during training, which enables the model to progressively learn from simple to complex queries using a composite reward system. During inference, it integrates token-level confidence and answer consistency to quantify uncertainty at the trajectory level, allowing the selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STaR outperforms existing methods in accuracy and reasoning stability. Additionally, the framework shows strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Overall, STaR represents a cognitively inspired and reliable approach to enhancing table reasoning capabilities in LLMs, addressing both the depth and reliability challenges inherent in this task. <div>
arXiv:2511.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

<div> Keywords: UAVBench, large language models, autonomous aerial systems, UAV reasoning, benchmark dataset<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper introduces UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. UAVBench consists of 50,000 UAV flight scenarios generated using taxonomy-guided LLM prompting combined with multi-stage safety validation to ensure scenario reliability. Each scenario is structured in JSON format and includes mission objectives, vehicle configurations, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels to facilitate a unified representation. The authors extend UAVBench with UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented dataset of 50,000 multiple-choice questions covering ten cognitive and ethical reasoning domains such as aerodynamics, navigation, multi-agent coordination, and integrated reasoning. The framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable evaluation of UAV-specific cognition within realistic operational contexts.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench

<div> Keywords: Ionic Liquids, Large Language Models, Property Prediction, Molecular Screening, Wet-lab Validation  

<br><br>Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenges in discovering new Ionic Liquids (ILs), which include limited data availability, low predictive accuracy of models, and fragmented workflows. To overcome these issues, the authors introduce AIonopedia, the first Large Language Model (LLM) agent specifically designed for IL discovery. AIonopedia is built upon a multimodal domain foundation model augmented by an LLM, enabling it to perform accurate property predictions for ILs. It features a hierarchical search architecture that facilitates efficient molecular screening and design processes. The model has been trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive dataset of ILs, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Further evaluations using literature-reported IL systems confirm AIonopedia’s ability to effectively modify ILs, supporting its reliability and versatility. Beyond computational experiments, the practical utility of AIonopedia was validated through wet-lab experiments, where it exhibited exceptional generalization abilities when handling challenging out-of-distribution IL discovery tasks. These results collectively highlight AIonopedia’s potential to significantly accelerate real-world discovery and optimization of novel Ionic Liquids. <div>

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

<div> Traceability, AI decisions, documentation, confidential computing, accountability  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the critical issue of insufficient documentation in AI decision-making processes, which impedes traceability and accountability, especially when decisions affect human well-being or rights. The authors propose a radical yet practical solution by enforcing comprehensive documentation for every component involved in AI training and inference. They introduce the first operational workflow designed to generate tamper-proof, verifiable, and exhaustive records of AI decisions, thereby facilitating responsibility tracing and legal scrutiny. The approach extends the existing Data-Bound Object Model (DBOM) concept into a functional workflow that employs confidential computing technology to enhance security and integrity of documentation. To demonstrate the practical application of their system, the authors develop an app designed to distinguish poisonous mushrooms from edible ones, serving as a playful but high-stakes example of decision support. This exemplification underscores the workflow’s effectiveness in real-world scenarios where AI decisions can have serious consequences. Overall, the paper contributes a robust framework aimed at increasing transparency, accountability, and legal defensibility of automated AI decisions through meticulous and secure documentation. <div>

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

<div> Contrastive explanations, ABox reasoning, description logics, computational complexity, ontology  

<br><br>Summary:  
This article introduces the concept of contrastive ABox explanations designed to answer queries like "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?" Unlike traditional approaches that explain positive or negative entailments separately, contrastive explanations handle both simultaneously, enabling a focus on the relevant similarities and differences between individuals a and b. The work develops a formal framework for such explanations specifically within the context of ABox reasoning using description logic ontologies. It further investigates the computational complexity of generating these explanations under various optimality criteria and across different description logics, from lightweight to more expressive ones. Additionally, the authors present an initial implementation targeting one variant of contrastive explanations, demonstrating the practical feasibility of their approach. Experimental evaluation is conducted on generated test cases reflective of realistic knowledge bases, providing initial insights into effectiveness and efficiency. This research thereby contributes both theoretically and practically to the field of ontology-based knowledge explanation by enabling more nuanced and informative contrastive reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

<div> jailbreak vulnerabilities, alignment, economic efficiency, LVLM, EcoAlign  

<br><br>Summary:  
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but face complex jailbreak vulnerabilities that pose significant safety challenges. The alignment of LVLMs goes beyond just safety concerns; it also implicates economic efficiency because current alignment methods must balance safety, utility, and operational costs. Existing approaches focus primarily on the final outputs, a process-blind strategy that wastes computational resources on unsafe reasoning that can be hidden beneath seemingly benign justifications, which evades simple safety measures. To resolve this, the authors introduce EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that treats LVLM alignment as an economically rational search problem by modeling the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally explores a thought graph and scores potential actions with a forward-looking function similar to net present value, dynamically weighing expected safety, utility, and costs against the remaining computational budget. To counteract potential deception, safety along reasoning paths is ensured by applying the weakest-link principle. The framework was tested extensively across three closed-source and two open-source LVLMs, using six datasets, where it achieved safety and utility performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational costs. EcoAlign thus offers a principled and economical solution for robust alignment of LVLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

<title>RLSLM: A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Framework Aligning Rule-Based Social Locomotion Model with Human Social Norms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: social navigation, reinforcement learning, social locomotion model, human comfort, VR experiment<br><br>Summary: Navigating environments populated by humans without causing discomfort is a crucial skill for socially-aware agents. Traditional rule-based methods provide interpretability based on predefined psychological principles but often lack flexibility and generalizability. On the other hand, purely data-driven techniques can learn intricate behaviors from large datasets but tend to be inefficient, opaque, and hard to align with human expectations. To address these challenges, the authors introduce RLSLM, a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model derived from empirical behavioral studies into its reward function. This model produces an orientation-sensitive social comfort field to quantitatively assess human comfort across spatial areas, facilitating navigation policies that align with social norms and require less training time. RLSLM optimizes both mechanical energy use and social comfort concurrently, enabling agents to steer clear of invading personal or group spaces. The framework's efficacy is validated through a human-agent interaction experiment conducted in an immersive virtual reality setup, where RLSLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art rule-based models in enhancing user experience. Additionally, ablation studies and sensitivity analyses demonstrate the model's superior interpretability relative to traditional data-driven approaches. Overall, this work delivers a scalable, human-centered methodology that successfully integrates cognitive science insights with machine learning techniques for practical social navigation applications. <div>

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

<div> Keywords: MarsRL, multi-agent reasoning, reinforcement learning, agentic pipeline parallelism, large language models<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The paper addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning depth due to their restricted output length during inference.<br>2. It identifies multi-agent reasoning systems, involving roles like Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, as a promising approach to iterative solution refinement but notes their poor generalization in open-source models caused by inadequate critic and correction abilities.<br>3.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

<div> Multi-agent reinforcement learning, communication constraints, robust communication, autonomous driving, federated learning<br><br>Summary:  
Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has advanced the coordination of autonomous agents, but most current methods assume ideal communication conditions such as instant, reliable, and unlimited bandwidth transmission, which rarely hold in real-world environments. This survey comprehensively reviews recent developments in communication strategies aimed at enhancing MARL robustness and efficiency under realistic constraints including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth availability. It emphasizes challenges related to maintaining low-latency reliable communication, managing bandwidth-heavy data sharing, and balancing communication with privacy concerns. The paper highlights three practical application areas where these communication challenges are critical: cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and federated learning. Finally, it identifies major open problems and future research directions, proposing a unified framework that concurrently designs communication protocols, learning algorithms, and robustness mechanisms. This integrated approach aims to close the gap between theoretical MARL frameworks and practical deployment scenarios, facilitating more reliable and efficient multi-agent systems in complex, communication-impaired settings. <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

<div> Keywords: agentic AI, inference-time adaptation, strategy generation, LLM meta-strategy, computational efficiency<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The paper addresses the challenge of enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving strategies dynamically based on interactions occurring after initial training, without being restricted to static or offline-optimized designs.  
2. Existing adaptive systems typically modify only the textual inputs at inference time, limiting their ability to change deeper components such as sampling parameters, tool usage, or control logic, and disallowing seamless switching between agentic and workflow paradigms.  
3. The proposed Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR) generates fully customized computational strategies at inference time by leveraging an LLM-based meta-strategy, which can adapt all components including prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic dynamically based on accumulated experience.  
4. EGuR consists of two main modules: a Guide that proposes multiple candidate strategies conditioned on both the current task and a structured memory of previous experiences, and a Consolidator that uses feedback from execution to refine future strategy generation.  
5. Evaluated on five difficult benchmarks—including AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and Big Bench Extra Hard tasks—EGuR delivers up to a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to the best existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational costs by up to 111 times, with performance gains increasing as the system continues to learn from experience. <div>
arXiv:2511.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

<title>Aligning Machiavellian Agents: Behavior Steering via Test-Time Policy Shaping</title>

<div> Keywords: AI alignment, policy shaping, reinforcement learning, ethical behavior, test-time control  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning AI decision-making agents with human ethical values during deployment, particularly in complex and dynamic environments. It highlights the difficulty of maintaining alignment in pre-trained agents since retraining is costly and slow, especially when ethical values are diverse and sometimes conflicting. To overcome these issues, the authors propose a test-time alignment method called model-guided policy shaping, which enables precise control of individual behavioral attributes without needing to retrain the agents. Their approach generalizes across various reinforcement learning (RL) environments and balances the trade-off between maximizing reward and ethical alignment in a principled way. The method is evaluated on the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, a large suite of 134 text-based games and thousands of ethically annotated decision scenarios. Initially, RL agents are trained solely for reward optimization in each game. Then, at test time, policy shaping is applied through scenario-action attribute classifiers to enforce ethical decision-making. The study compares this strategy against previous training-time alignment methods and general-purpose AI agents, analyzing different ethical violations and tendencies toward power-seeking. Results show that test-time policy shaping offers an effective, scalable solution to reduce unethical behavior across a wide range of environments and alignment criteria. <div>

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

<div> Computational humor, Large Language Models, Oogiri, empathy, multifaceted evaluation<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper explores computational humor as an advanced area in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for enhancing dialogue systems. It critiques previous evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) that used overly simplistic, single-dimensional humor assessments, such as binary judgments of "funny" versus "not funny." The study focuses on the Japanese improvisational comedy game Oogiri to provide a richer, multifaceted perspective on humor. Researchers compiled a significantly expanded dataset by adding new sources and LLM-generated Oogiri responses. They then manually annotated this dataset using a 5-point scale across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using these data, the team evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on two tasks: generating creative Oogiri responses and evaluating the funniness of responses with the six-dimensional criteria. Results showed that LLMs produce humor roughly equivalent to low- to mid-tier human performance but notably lack empathy, which explains their poor alignment with human humor assessments. Correlation analysis revealed that LLMs emphasize Novelty in humor evaluation, while humans prioritize Empathy. The authors release the annotated corpus publicly to facilitate the creation of more emotionally intelligent conversational agents. <div>

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

<div> Keywords: agentic applications, cycle detection, large language models, semantic analysis, stock market application  

<br><br>Summary:  
1. Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can create hidden execution cycles, which silently consume computational resources without producing explicit errors.  
2. Traditional observability platforms typically fail to detect these inefficiencies, leading to wasted resources and undiagnosed performance issues.  
3. The authors propose an unsupervised cycle detection framework that integrates both structural and semantic analysis techniques to address this problem effectively.  
4. The framework first performs a computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to detect explicit loops in the execution trajectories.  
5. It then applies semantic similarity analysis to identify subtle, semantic-level cycles characterized by repetitive or redundant content generation that structural methods may miss.  
6. The approach was evaluated on 1575 trajectories obtained from a LangGraph-based stock market application, demonstrating a combined F1 score of 0.72, with precision of 0.62 and recall of 0.86.  
7. This hybrid method significantly outperforms standalone structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic (F1: 0.28) cycle detection approaches, showing the value of combining both analyses.  
8. Despite promising results, the authors acknowledge substantial room for improvement and highlight the necessity for future research to refine the framework and overcome current limitations. <div>

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

<div> Keywords: simulation deduction, large language models, multi-round interactions, structured data extraction, report generation<br><br>Summary: This article addresses the challenges of analyzing and evaluating simulation deduction data in modern warfare, which is crucial for assessing strategies and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis methods are inefficient and prone to errors. To improve accuracy and efficiency, the authors propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) known for their analytical and inferencing capabilities. Recognizing that a single instruction input to LLMs cannot yield high-quality, well-structured analysis reports, the method decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks, designing specific system and user prompts for each. Through multi-round interactions that incorporate self-checking and reflection, the model facilitates structured data extraction coupled with multi-step analysis and evaluation. Additionally, custom tools are developed to generate figures and compute relevant metrics, enhancing the report's informativeness. The approach includes multiple report templates tailored to different applications and input data types, ensuring adaptability across diverse scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that reports produced by this method surpass those generated by baseline approaches in terms of quality and scoring, validating the effectiveness of the proposed solution. <div>

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

<div> Keywords: large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, episodic memory, biographical data, historical dialogue systems  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing response depth and latency in embodying historical characters within dialogue systems using large language models (LLMs). It proposes an architecture that leverages offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from a structured episodic memory. The system converts extensive biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories annotated with affective-semantic metadata, enabling more nuanced responses. A novel two-stage retrieval process reduces prompt generation latency to 0.52 seconds, significantly improving efficiency compared to multi-stage reflection methods. Evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge and RAGAs metrics demonstrates that this approach matches traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on GPT-4 and outperforms it on smaller models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, highlighting its suitability for resource-constrained environments. Beyond dialogue generation, the structured memory supports innovative visualization tools, including spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, facilitating biographical research and analysis. Van Gogh is used as a primary test case, but the architecture is adaptable to any historical figure with adequate textual records. This framework offers practical benefits for educational, museum, and research applications by combining accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability in historical dialogue systems. <div>

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

<div> Quantum Computing, Large Language Models, Variational Quantum Circuits, Hybrid Quantum-Classical, Natural Language Generation<br><br>Summary: This article presents HyQuT, the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model designed for natural language generation tasks, specifically coherent and context-aware dialogue. Unlike previous quantum or hybrid models limited to simpler tasks, HyQuT integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) directly into the Transformer architecture at two scales: 8 million and 150 million parameters. The research demonstrates that using only 10 qubits and 80 quantum gates can effectively replace approximately 10% of the classical parameters in the large 150M-parameter model without sacrificing convergence stability or the quality of the generated text. This approach marks a significant step in combining quantum computing with large-scale generative models and provides an early proof-of-concept for future quantum-enhanced natural language processing systems. The results suggest that quantum components can serve as efficient substitutes for some classical components in deep learning models, potentially leading to more resource-efficient and powerful AI architectures. Overall, the work highlights the feasibility and potential benefits of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks applied to the demanding domain of large-scale language generation. <div>

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, temporal constraints, deadline detection, fine-tuning, architectural limitations<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This work evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) perform in agentic settings that require real-time decisions under temporal constraints, specifically focusing on their ability to detect if action deadlines are still open or have closed. The study tests eight production-scale models ranging from 2.8 billion to 8 billion parameters and finds a bimodal distribution in performance: models either achieve high accuracy (~95%) or perform at chance (~50%). Results reveal extreme brittleness to prompt formatting changes, which can shift accuracy dramatically by 30-60 percentage points. Additionally, failing models exhibit a systematic bias with 100% false positive rates in deadline failures. Interestingly, model size does not correlate with temporal reasoning capability in this range—some smaller models outperform larger ones. Attempts to improve performance by fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples yield moderate gains (12-37 percentage points) for partially capable models. The authors argue that temporal constraint satisfaction is not learnable reliably through next-token prediction on natural language alone, even when fine-tuned. Instead, they propose that robust time-critical reasoning requires architectural features enabling continuous temporal state representation, explicit checking of constraints separate from language patterns, and systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive LLMs lack these mechanisms, implying that deploying them in critical real-time applications without integrating symbolic or hybrid architectures carries significant risks. <div>

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

<div> Keywords: Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning, transformer-based node merging, sentence-level entailment validation, external knowledge graph alignment, semantic preprocessing  

<br><br>Summary:  
This report presents enhancements to the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework through three semantically grounded improvements aimed at refining graph quality while maintaining the underlying spectral reasoning process. First, it introduces transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings, such as Sentence-BERT and SimCSE, to effectively reduce redundancy among graph nodes. Second, it employs sentence-level entailment validation leveraging pretrained natural language inference (NLI) classifiers like RoBERTa and DeBERTa, thus improving the quality of edges within the reasoning graph. Third, the framework integrates alignment with external knowledge graphs, including ConceptNet and Wikidata, to fill in missing context and augment the graph’s semantic fidelity. These preprocessing steps are modular and occur entirely upstream of spectral inference, preserving system efficiency and interpretability without resorting to computationally expensive quadratic attention mechanisms. Experimental validation across datasets such as ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements—up to 3.8%—better generalization to adversarial inputs, and reduced inference noise. The work's novelty lies in enhancing graph construction semantically and symbolically prior to the spectral stage, resulting in a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system poised for deployment in open-domain and practical real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, multi-objective alignment, preference weights, PReference Orchestrator, reward models  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences spanning multiple objectives. Current methods depend on manually specified preference weights, which complicate user input and reduce training efficiency by exploring irrelevant preference combinations. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce PRO (PReference Orchestrator), a novel framework incorporating a lightweight preference adapter. This adapter automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment stages, eliminating the need for manual preference specification. The critical mechanism involves the adapter learning appropriate weights based on normalized reward scores obtained from multiple reward models, which capture the effectiveness of preferences across objectives. The authors also provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that this prompt-aware preference weighting outperforms fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment. Extensive experiments conducted on various tasks validate the superiority of PRO compared to existing multi-objective alignment approaches, showing improved alignment results and training efficiency. The method thus offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution to multi-objective preference alignment in LLM deployments. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

<div> Keywords: large language models, clinical reports, prompting strategies, multi-institutional, structured data extraction<br><br>Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly applied to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, yet prior studies typically focus on single tasks, fewer models, and English-only data. This study evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs, including both general-purpose and medical-specialised models of varying sizes, across pathology and radiology reports covering six diverse use cases: colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas. Data were collected from three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic, featuring reports in multiple languages. Six prompting strategies—zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph—were compared to assess their impact on performance. The results showed that top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores approaching human inter-rater agreement. Notably, small-to-medium-sized general models performed comparably to larger ones, whereas tiny and specialised models lagged behind. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting notably improved performance by approximately 13%. Importantly, task-specific factors such as annotation variability and complexity had a greater influence on results than model size or prompting strategy. These findings demonstrate that open-weight LLMs offer a scalable and effective approach for cross-disease, multilingual, and multi-institution clinical data curation. <div>

Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

<div> Keywords: lossless compression, universal compressors, neural compressors, test-time steering, weighted product of experts<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The paper addresses the challenge of improving lossless data compression, which is critical given the rapid increase in data volume worldwide. 2.

This method adaptively fuses the strengths of both models so that the resulting compression rate is at least as good as the best individual model without requiring additional fine-tuning. 6. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in text compression performance and robustness across various data distributions. 7. Additionally, the proposed framework is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated with any autoregressive language model, offering a practical and effective solution for enhancing text compression in diverse applications. <div>

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

This paper evaluates seven state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) — GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, LLaMA 3.1, Mistral Large 2, LLaMA-2 Chat 13B, and Mistral 7B Instruct — on a novel benchmark spanning Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish. The benchmark covers four tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-target language translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. The evaluation combines human judgments focusing on fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness alongside automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE to provide a comprehensive overview of model performance. Results indicate that the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude 3.5) generally outperform others across languages and tasks, with GPT-4o showing robust multilingual capacity and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrating competitive knowledge and reasoning accuracy. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain regarding culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization, particularly due to Turkish’s agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (such as LLaMA-2 13B and Mistral 7B) lag notably in fluency and accuracy, underscoring the resource gap in low-resource language modeling. The paper includes detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analyses, and discusses implications for improving cultural awareness and linguistic generalizability, releasing the benchmark data to support future research and reproducibility. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

<div> Keywords: guard models, semantic robustness, paraphrase consistency, skew-aware aggregation, model calibration  

<br><br>Summary: Guard models play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs), but they are vulnerable to superficial linguistic variations that do not change meaning. This study demonstrates that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause significant fluctuations in these models’ safety scores, indicating a lack of true semantic understanding. To counter this, the authors propose a novel, self-supervised training framework designed to enhance the semantic robustness of guard models. Their approach uses sets of paraphrases and enforces prediction consistency through a new skew-aware aggregation strategy to compute more reliable targets. Experiments with six open-source guard models reveal that traditional aggregation methods like mean and median can sometimes harm safety performance, highlighting the need for skew-aware techniques. The proposed method reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by approximately 58%, boosts benchmark accuracy by around 2.5%, and generalizes well to unseen stylistic changes. Additionally, the authors uncover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and prediction consistency: improving semantic robustness also enhances calibration by up to 40%. These findings emphasize the importance of treating semantic consistency as a primary training objective and offer a scalable approach to developing safer and more reliable guard models. <div>

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, understanding, decision factors, evaluation, STaDS<br><br>Summary: Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate high predictive accuracy but this accuracy does not necessarily equate to genuine understanding. True understanding in LLMs is defined as the ability to make consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and domains by relying on relevant, domain-specific decision factors. The paper introduces Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs within expert-like decision-making scenarios, resembling professional exams. STaDS assesses understanding through three key dimensions: question and instruction comprehension, knowledge-based prediction, and the reliance on proper decision factors that truly determine outcomes. In their extensive evaluation of nine state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen different decision settings, the authors discovered that most models struggle to maintain consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains. Moreover, models often exhibit global unfaithfulness, with frequent discrepancies between their stated rationales and the actual factors influencing predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of developing evaluation protocols that go beyond simple accuracy metrics to assess a model’s deeper understanding. The work advocates for new frameworks aimed at enhancing LLMs’ ability to truly understand and reliably apply relevant decision factors in complex, multi-domain contexts. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, text-to-SQL, continual learning, human feedback, memory-augmented agents<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenge faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate SQL queries from natural language, especially when dealing with database-specific schemas and implicit domain knowledge. The authors propose a novel framework for continual learning that leverages human feedback in a text-to-SQL setting, allowing a learning agent to iteratively refine its queries based on natural language corrections. The framework is designed to distill the tacit knowledge revealed through human interactions into a structured memory system, thereby enabling the agent to reuse this knowledge for improved performance on future tasks. Multiple agent architectures are explored, varying in their methods for capturing and retrieving past experiences. Experimental results on the BIRD benchmark Dev set demonstrate that agents enhanced with memory, particularly the Procedural Agent variant, achieve significant improvements in execution accuracy and a substantial reduction in errors by effectively incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback. This work underscores the value of transforming implicit human expertise into explicit, reusable knowledge, contributing toward more adaptive and domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continuously improve through interaction with human users. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.

<title>Learn to Select: Exploring Label Distribution Divergence for In-Context Demonstration Selection in Text Classification</title>

<div> Keywords: In-context learning, demonstration selection, label distribution, text classification, large language models<br><br>Summary: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification uses a few input-label demonstrations to define a task and has shown strong performance with large language models (LLMs). The selection of these demonstrations is crucial and greatly influences LLM performance. Traditional demonstration selection methods mainly focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and candidate demonstrations but often neglect the alignment of label distributions. To improve this, the authors propose a two-stage demonstration selection approach called TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D). This method employs a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to estimate label distributions for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations, then calculates their divergence to select demonstrations that are semantically similar and have aligned label distributions. Extensive experiments on seven text classification benchmarks demonstrate that the L2D method consistently outperforms prior demonstration selection strategies. Additional analysis shows a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs in ICL and the accuracy of the underlying SLM used for label distribution estimation, highlighting the importance of precise label distribution modeling for improving demonstration selection and overall classification results. <div>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $\pi$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + \pi \log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $\pi$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

<title>Bias-Restrained Prefix Representation Finetuning for Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

<title>Do Not Merge My Model! Safeguarding Open-Source LLMs Against Unauthorized Model Merging</title>

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient technique for expanding large language models (LLMs) by integrating specialized expert models. However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging. The core design of MergeBarrier is to disrupt the Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) between the protected model and its homologous counterparts, thereby eliminating the low-loss path required for effective model merging. Extensive experiments show that MergeBarrier effectively prevents model merging stealing with negligible accuracy loss.

<title>BadThink: Triggered Overthinking Attacks on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but have also introduced their computational efficiency as a new attack surface. In this paper, we propose BadThink, the first backdoor attack designed to deliberately induce "overthinking" behavior in CoT-enabled LLMs while ensuring stealth. When activated by carefully crafted trigger prompts, BadThink manipulates the model to generate inflated reasoning traces - producing unnecessarily redundant thought processes while preserving the consistency of final outputs. This subtle attack vector creates a covert form of performance degradation that significantly increases computational costs and inference time while remaining difficult to detect through conventional output evaluation methods. We implement this attack through a sophisticated poisoning-based fine-tuning strategy, employing a novel LLM-based iterative optimization process to embed the behavior by generating highly naturalistic poisoned data. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art models and reasoning tasks show that BadThink consistently increases reasoning trace lengths - achieving an over 17x increase on the MATH-500 dataset - while remaining stealthy and robust. This work reveals a critical, previously unexplored vulnerability where reasoning efficiency can be covertly manipulated, demonstrating a new class of sophisticated attacks against CoT-enabled systems.

<title>PISanitizer: Preventing Prompt Injection to Long-Context LLMs via Prompt Sanitization</title>

Abstract: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/sleeepeer/PISanitizer.

Abstract: The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of engineering designs is limited by non-differentiable components in the typical computer-aided engineering (CAE) workflow, which calculates performance metrics from design parameters. While gradient-based methods could provide noticeable speed-ups in high-dimensional design spaces, codes for meshing, physical simulations, and other common components are not differentiable even if the math or physics underneath them is. We propose replacing non-differentiable pipeline components with surrogate models which are inherently differentiable. Using a toy example of aerodynamic shape optimization, we demonstrate an end-to-end differentiable pipeline where a 3D U-Net full-field surrogate replaces both meshing and simulation steps by training it on the mapping between the signed distance field (SDF) of the shape and the fields of interest. This approach enables gradient-based shape optimization without the need for differentiable solvers, which can be useful in situations where adjoint methods are unavailable and/or hard to implement.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce TEDxTN, the first publicly available Tunisian Arabic to English speech translation dataset. This work is in line with the ongoing effort to mitigate the data scarcity obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects. We collected, segmented, transcribed and translated 108 TEDx talks following our internally developed annotations guidelines. The collected talks represent 25 hours of speech with code-switching that cover speakers with various accents from over 11 different regions of Tunisia. We make the annotation guidelines and corpus publicly available. This will enable the extension of TEDxTN to new talks as they become available. We also report results for strong baseline systems of Speech Recognition and Speech Translation using multiple pre-trained and fine-tuned end-to-end models. This corpus is the first open source and publicly available speech translation corpus of Code-Switching Tunisian dialect. We believe that this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research on the natural language processing of Tunisian Dialect.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

Abstract: We study a Stackelberg variant of the classical Most Vital Links problem, modeled as a one-round adversarial game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker strategically removes up to $k$ edges from a flow network to maximally disrupt flow between a source $s$ and a sink $t$, after which the defender optimally reroutes the remaining flow. To capture this attacker--defender interaction, we introduce a new mathematical model of discounted cuts, in which the cost of a cut is evaluated by excluding its $k$ most expensive edges. This model generalizes the Most Vital Links problem and uncovers novel algorithmic and complexity-theoretic properties.
  We develop a unified algorithmic framework for analyzing various forms of discounted cut problems, including minimizing or maximizing the cost of a cut under discount mechanisms that exclude either the $k$ most expensive or the $k$ cheapest edges. While most variants are NP-complete on general graphs, our main result establishes polynomial-time solvability for all discounted cut problems in our framework when the input is restricted to bounded-genus graphs, a relevant class that includes many real-world networks such as transportation and infrastructure networks. With this work, we aim to open collaborative bridges between artificial intelligence, algorithmic game theory, and operations research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Abstract: Communication networks are essential for our economy and our everyday lives. This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.
  This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.

Abstract: Unit testing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is critical but challenged by parallelism, complex algorithms, and diverse hardware. Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: Newsrooms and journalists across the world are adopting Generative AI (GenAI). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 23 journalists, this study identifies Bangladeshi journalists' awareness, acceptance, usage patterns, and their media organizations' stance toward GenAI. This study finds Bangladeshi journalists' high reliance on GenAI like their Western colleagues despite limited institutional support and the near absence of AI policy. Despite this contrast, concerns over GenAI's implications in journalism between the West and non-West were mostly identical. Moreover, this study contributes to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by proposing two changes regarding GenAI adoption among journalists in non-Western settings. First, this study identifies the non-contribution of facilitating conditions in shaping behavioral intent in GenAI adoption in non-Western contexts. Second, social influence works in a horizontal order through informal peer pressure or professional motivation in the absence of formal institutional hierarchical pressure. Voluntariness in the context of Bangladeshi journalists is underpinned by their professional compulsion. Therefore, this study contributes to understanding how contextual factors shape technology adoption trajectories in non-Western journalism.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Short-Window Sliding Learning framework for real-time violence detection in CCTV footages. Unlike conventional long-video training approaches, the proposed method divides videos into 1-2 second clips and applies Large Language Model (LLM)-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets. Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 95.25\% accuracy on RWF-2000 and significantly improves performance on long videos (UCF-Crime: 83.25\%), confirming its strong generalization and real-time applicability in intelligent surveillance systems.

<title>Incorporating Spatial Information into Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Graph Representations</title>

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

<title>A Multifaceted Analysis of Negative Bias in Large Language Models through the Lens of Parametric Knowledge</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10881</link>

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting. A video projector (V-JEPA Vision Transformer) associated to a lightweight probabilistic head is attached to a pre-trained satellite vision encoder (DINOv3\text{-}SAT493M) to map encoder tokens into a discrete empirical CDF (eCDF) over 4-hour accumulated rainfall. The projector-head is optimized end-to-end over the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). As an alternative, 3D-UNET baselines trained with an aggregate Rank Probability Score and a per-pixel Gamma-Hurdle objective are used. On the Weather4Cast 2025 benchmark, the proposed method achieved a promising performance, with a CRPS of 3.5102 (CRPS), which represents $\approx$26\% in effectiveness gain against the best 3D-UNET.

<title>CLIPPan: Adapting CLIP as A Supervisor for Unsupervised Pansharpening</title>

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in supervised pansharpening neural networks, these methods face domain adaptation challenges of resolution due to the intrinsic disparity between simulated reduced-resolution training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening framework, CLIPPan, that enables model training at full resolution directly by taking CLIP, a visual-language model, as a supervisor. However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across diverse domains, yet their performance on rare disease diagnosis from narrative medical cases remains underexplored. We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.

<title>Synthetic Voices, Real Threats: Evaluating Large Text-to-Speech Models in Generating Harmful Audio</title>

Abstract: Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those built on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), generate high-fidelity speech that faithfully reproduces input text and mimics specified speaker identities. While prior misuse studies have focused on speaker impersonation, this work explores a distinct content-centric threat: exploiting TTS systems to produce speech containing harmful content. Realizing such threats poses two core challenges: (1) LALM safety alignment frequently rejects harmful prompts, yet existing jailbreak attacks are ill-suited for TTS because these systems are designed to faithfully vocalize any input text, and (2) real-world deployment pipelines often employ input/output filters that block harmful text and audio.
  We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges. The first family employs semantic obfuscation techniques (Concat, Shuffle) that conceal harmful content within text. The second leverages audio-modality exploits (Read, Spell, Phoneme) that inject harmful content through auxiliary audio channels while maintaining benign textual prompts. Through evaluation across five commercial LALMs-based TTS systems and three datasets spanning two languages, we demonstrate that our attacks substantially reduce refusal rates and increase the toxicity of generated speech.
  We further assess both reactive countermeasures deployed by audio-streaming platforms and proactive defenses implemented by TTS providers. Our analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities: deepfake detectors underperform on high-fidelity audio; reactive moderation can be circumvented by adversarial perturbations; while proactive moderation detects 57-93% of attacks. Our work highlights a previously underexplored content-centric misuse vector for TTS and underscore the need for robust cross-modal safeguards throughout training and deployment.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are being increasingly employed for credit risk evaluation, with their effectiveness largely hinging on the quality of the input data. In this paper we investigate the impact of several data quality issues, including missing values, noisy attributes, outliers, and label errors, on the predictive accuracy of the machine learning model used in credit risk assessment. Utilizing an open-source dataset, we introduce controlled data corruption using the Pucktrick library to assess the robustness of 10 frequently used models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression and so on. Our experiments show significant differences in model robustness based on the nature and severity of the data degradation. Moreover, the proposed methodology and accompanying tools offer practical support for practitioners seeking to enhance data pipeline robustness, and provide researchers with a flexible framework for further experimentation in data-centric AI contexts.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Abstract: Recognizing speaker intent in long audio dialogues among speakers has a wide range of applications, but is a non-trivial AI task due to complex inter-dependencies in speaker utterances and scarce annotated data. To address these challenges, an end-to-end framework, namely DialogGraph-LLM, is proposed in the current work. DialogGraph-LLM combines a novel Multi-Relational Dialogue Attention Network (MR-DAN) architecture with multimodal foundation models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni-7B) for direct acoustic-to-intent inference. An adaptive semi-supervised learning strategy is designed using LLM with a confidence-aware pseudo-label generation mechanism based on dual-threshold filtering using both global and class confidences, and an entropy-based sample selection process that prioritizes high-information unlabeled instances. Extensive evaluations on the proprietary MarketCalls corpus and the publicly available MIntRec 2.0 benchmark demonstrate DialogGraph-LLM's superiority over strong audio and text-driven baselines. The framework demonstrates strong performance and efficiency in intent recognition in real world scenario audio dialogues, proving its practical value for audio-rich domains with limited supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/david188888/DialogGraph-LLM.

Abstract: Audio classification plays an essential role in sentiment analysis and emotion recognition, especially for analyzing customer attitudes in marketing phone calls. Efficiently categorizing customer purchasing propensity from large volumes of audio data remains challenging. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-Segment Multi-Task Fusion Network (MSMT-FN) that is uniquely designed for addressing this business demand. Evaluations conducted on our proprietary MarketCalls dataset, as well as established benchmarks (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD), show MSMT-FN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our newly curated MarketCalls dataset will be available upon request, and the code base is made accessible at GitHub Repository MSMT-FN, to facilitate further research and advancements in audio classification domain.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

<title>Data Poisoning Vulnerabilities Across Healthcare AI Architectures: A Security Threat Analysis</title>

Abstract: Healthcare AI systems face major vulnerabilities to data poisoning that current defenses and regulations cannot adequately address. We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards. We also question whether opaque black-box models are suitable for high-stakes clinical decisions, suggesting a shift toward interpretable systems with verifiable safety guarantees.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + \mu$, where $\mu$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $\sigma$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $\sigma$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $\sigma$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $\mu$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $\mu$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\delta$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

Abstract: How to best use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering is covered in many publications in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, is still underexplored. Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used. We show that few-shot prompting approaches are sufficient to solve simple problems in a language that is otherwise not well-supported by an LLM and that is possible on-premise, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive company data.

Abstract: This paper presents the AR fairness metamodel, aimed at formally representing, analyzing, and comparing fairness scenarios. The metamodel provides an abstract representation of fairness, enabling the formal definition of fairness notions. We instantiate the metamodel through several examples, with a particular focus on comparing the notions of equity and equality.
  We use the Tiles framework, which offers modular components that can be interconnected to represent various definitions of fairness. Its primary objective is to support the operationalization of AR-based fairness definitions in a range of scenarios, providing a robust method for defining, comparing, and evaluating fairness.
  Tiles has an open-source implementation for fairness modeling and evaluation.

<title>OT-ALD: Aligning Latent Distributions with Optimal Transport for Accelerated Image-to-Image Translation</title>

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

<title>Refine and Align: Confidence Calibration through Multi-Agent Interaction in VQA</title>

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Abstract: The growing popularity of group activities increased the need to develop methods for providing recommendations to a group of users based on the collective preferences of the group members. Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Abstract: Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics. The dataset is publicly available on ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17566690).

<title>D-GAP: Improving Out-of-Domain Robustness via Dataset-Agnostic and Gradient-Guided Augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel Spaces</title>

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces  and  tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$\pi_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$\pi_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility. We introduce NOVA, an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code. NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.

Abstract: Quantum Computing is a rapidly developing field with the potential to tackle the increasing computational challenges faced in high-energy physics. In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.

<title>The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

<title>Retrofit: Continual Learning with Bounded Forgetting for Security Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11439</link>

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

<title>Epistemic Error Decomposition for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting: Rethinking Bias-Variance in Recursive and Direct Strategies</title>

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

<title>Benchmarking Visual LLMs Resilience to Unanswerable Questions on Visually Rich Documents</title>

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on timely insights from complex visual data. While Information Visualization (InfoVis) dashboards can support this process, they rarely adapt to users' cognitive state, and less so in real time. We present Symbiotik, an intelligent, context-aware adaptive visualization system that leverages neurophysiological signals to estimate mental workload (MWL) and dynamically adapt visual dashboards using reinforcement learning (RL). Through a user study with 120 participants and three visualization types, we demonstrate that our approach improves task performance and engagement. Symbiotik offers a scalable, real-time adaptation architecture, and a validated methodology for neuroadaptive user interfaces.

Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Abstract: Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous laboratories typically rely on data-driven decision-making, occasionally with human-in-the-loop oversight to inject domain expertise. Fully leveraging AI agents, however, requires tightly coupled, collaborative workflows spanning hypothesis generation, experimental planning, execution, and interpretation. To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer. HAIC stages human insight with AI reasoning between autonomous batches to drive rapid scientific progress, providing an evolution to many existing human-in-the-loop autonomous workflows.

Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

Abstract: We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection}~(SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $\Theta\bigl(\omega \log_2(k/\omega)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $\omega \approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $\Theta(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = \Theta(\log k)$), this becomes $\Theta(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022), while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) research today is largely driven by ever-larger neural network models trained on graphics processing units (GPUs). This paradigm has yielded remarkable progress, but it also risks entrenching a hardware lottery in which algorithmic choices succeed primarily because they align with current hardware, rather than because they are inherently superior. In particular, the dominance of Transformer architectures running on GPU clusters has led to an arms race of scaling up models, resulting in exorbitant computational costs and energy usage. At the same time, today's AI models often remain unreliable in the sense that they cannot properly quantify uncertainty in their decisions -- for example, large language models tend to hallucinate incorrect outputs with high confidence.
  This article argues that achieving more efficient and reliable AI will require embracing a set of principles that are well-aligned with the goals of neuromorphic engineering, which are in turn inspired by how the brain processes information. Specifically, we outline six key neuromorphic principles, spanning algorithms, architectures, and hardware, that can inform the design of future AI systems: (i) the use of stateful, recurrent models; (ii) extreme dynamic sparsity, possibly down to spike-based processing; (iii) backpropagation-free on-device learning and fine-tuning; (iv) probabilistic decision-making; (v) in-memory computing; and (vi) hardware-software co-design via stochastic computing. We discuss each of these principles in turn, surveying relevant prior work and pointing to directions for research.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for assigning quantifiable and psychometrically validated personalities to AI-Agents using the Big Five framework. Across three studies, we evaluate its feasibility and limitations. In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment. In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) in different format, and find that AI-Agents powered by new models align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test, although the finer pattern of results (e.g., factor loading patterns) were sometimes inconsistent. In Study 3, we validate our AI-Agents on risk-taking and moral dilemma vignettes, finding that models prompted with the BFI-2-Expanded format most closely reproduce human personality-decision associations, while safety-aligned models generally inflate 'moral' ratings. Overall, our results show that AI-Agents align with humans in correlations between input Big Five traits and output responses and may serve as useful tools for preliminary research. Nevertheless, discrepancies in finer response patterns indicate that AI-Agents cannot (yet) fully substitute for human participants in precision or high-stakes projects.

Abstract: Ever since the vision was formulated, the Semantic Web has inspired many generations of innovations. Semantic technologies have been used to share vast amounts of information on the Web, enhance them with semantics to give them meaning, and enable inference and reasoning on them. Throughout the years, semantic technologies, and in particular knowledge graphs, have been used in search engines, data integration, enterprise settings, and machine learning. In this paper, we recap the classical concepts and foundations of the Semantic Web as well as modern and recent concepts and applications, building upon these foundations. The classical topics we cover include knowledge representation, creating and validating knowledge on the Web, reasoning and linking, and distributed querying. We enhance this classical view of the so-called ``Semantic Web Layer Cake'' with an update of recent concepts. These include provenance, security and trust, as well as a discussion of practical impacts from industry-led contributions. We also provide an overiew of shallow and deep machine learning methods for knowledge graphs and discuss the relation of language models and knowledge graphs. We conclude with an outlook on the future directions of the Semantic Web.

Abstract: The discovery of symbolic solutions -- mathematical expressions, logical rules, and algorithmic structures -- is fundamental to advancing scientific and engineering progress.
  However, traditional methods often struggle with search efficiency and fail to integrate knowledge effectively.
  While recent large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches have demonstrated improvements in search efficiency, they lack the ability to continually refine and expand upon discovered solutions and their underlying knowledge, limiting their potential for open-ended innovation.
  To address these limitations, we introduce CoEvo, a novel framework that leverages large language models within an evolutionary search methodology to continually generate and refine symbolic solutions. CoEvo integrates a dynamic knowledge library, enabling open-ended innovation of solutions through effective knowledge management. Additionally, CoEvo leverages multiple representations of solutions -- including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code -- to further enhance search efficiency.
  By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the exploratory power of evolutionary algorithms, CoEvo significantly improves the efficiency and scope of symbolic discovery.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative
  process, marking a significant step towards harnessing LLMs in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents through the generation of control policies that directly map continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. At the outset, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. The approach proves effective with relatively compact models such as GPT-oss:120b and Qwen2.5:72b. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Abstract: Representing the temporal evolution of legal norms is a critical challenge for automated processing. While foundational frameworks exist, they lack a formal pattern for granular, component-level versioning, hindering the deterministic point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts required by reliable AI applications. This paper proposes a structured, temporal modeling pattern grounded in the LRMoo ontology. Our approach models a norm's evolution as a diachronic chain of versioned F1 Works, distinguishing between language-agnostic Temporal Versions (TV)-each being a distinct Work-and their monolingual Language Versions (LV), modeled as F2 Expressions. The legislative amendment process is formalized through event-centric modeling, allowing changes to be traced precisely. Using the Brazilian Constitution as a case study, we demonstrate that our architecture enables the exact reconstruction of any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. This provides a verifiable semantic backbone for legal knowledge graphs, offering a deterministic foundation for trustworthy legal AI.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust, adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data, minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment. Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

<title>Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

<title>Efficient Story Point Estimation With Comparative Learning</title>

Abstract: Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development. Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is, state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects. The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments - providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than providing ratings or categorical labels.

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks, inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician (\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly. NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments, NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping, producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint, based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA insights in an accessible format.

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms. Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively, 20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1% less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations in the utility function.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios. Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second, we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse, persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment. Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations, integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency, offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention (which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

Abstract: In existing splicing forgery datasets, the insufficient semantic variety of spliced regions causes trained detection models to overfit semantic features rather than learn genuine splicing traces. Meanwhile, the lack of a reasonable benchmark dataset has led to inconsistent experimental settings across existing detection methods. To address these issues, we propose GreatSplicing, a manually created, large-scale, high-quality splicing dataset. GreatSplicing comprises 5,000 spliced images and covers spliced regions across 335 distinct semantic categories, enabling detection models to learn splicing traces more effectively. Empirical results show that detection models trained on GreatSplicing achieve low misidentification rates and stronger cross-dataset generalization compared to existing datasets. GreatSplicing is now publicly available for research purposes at the following link.

Abstract: Live languages continuously evolve to integrate the cultural change of human societies. This evolution manifests through neologisms (new words) or \textbf{semantic changes} of words (new meaning to existing words). Understanding the meaning of words is vital for interpreting texts coming from different cultures (regionalism or slang), domains (e.g., technical terms), or periods. In computer science, these words are relevant to computational linguistics algorithms such as translation, information retrieval, question answering, etc. Semantic changes can potentially impact the quality of the outcomes of these algorithms. Therefore, it is important to understand and characterize these changes formally. The study of this impact is a recent problem that has attracted the attention of the computational linguistics community. Several approaches propose methods to detect semantic changes with good precision, but more effort is needed to characterize how the meaning of words changes and to reason about how to reduce the impact of semantic change. This survey provides an understandable overview of existing approaches to the \textit{characterization of semantic changes} and also formally defines three classes of characterizations: if the meaning of a word becomes more general or narrow (change in dimension) if the word is used in a more pejorative or positive/ameliorated sense (change in orientation), and if there is a trend to use the word in a, for instance, metaphoric or metonymic context (change in relation). We summarized the main aspects of the selected publications in a table and discussed the needs and trends in the research activities on semantic change characterization.

<title>MoPE: Mixture of Prompt Experts for Parameter-Efficient and Scalable Multimodal Fusion</title>

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated parameter efficiency of prompt-based fusion, its limited adaptivity and expressiveness hinder its effectiveness for multimodal applications at scale. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study addressing these limitations. Our key motivation is to ``divide and conquer'' the vanilla prompt, traditionally shared across all instances, by generating instance-specific prompts. Specifically, we propose the Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE), a framework that significantly enhances prompt adaptivity and expressiveness by dynamically generating instance-specific prompts. MoPE leverages multimodal pairings as additional evidence, allowing the model to adaptively select optimal prompts tailored to each individual instance. Unlike traditional prompt-fusion methods, which encounter scalability bottlenecks when optimizing long unified prompts, MoPE maintains fixed prompt length while effectively scaling the number of specialized experts. Moreover, we investigate regularization terms to encourage expert specialization, resulting in highly adaptive and interpretable prompting. MoPE fundamentally changes the scaling dynamic, unlocking greater expressiveness and adaptability to complex multimodal relationships, enabling the model to selectively attend to task-relevant sub-sequences based on instance-specific multimodal input. Extensive experiments across six multimodal datasets spanning four modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for multimodal fusion, matching or surpassing the performance of fine-tuning while requiring only 0.8% of the trainable parameters. Code is available: https://github.com/songrise/MoPE.

<title>Fractured Glass, Failing Cameras: Simulating Physics-Based Adversarial Samples for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: While much research has recently focused on generating physics-based adversarial samples, a critical yet often overlooked category originates from physical failures within on-board cameras-components essential to the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. Camera failures, whether due to external stresses causing hardware breakdown or internal component faults, can directly jeopardize the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To assess the safety implications, we apply the simulated broken glass effects as image filters to two autonomous driving datasets- KITTI and BDD100K- as well as the large-scale image detection dataset MS-COCO. We then evaluate detection failure rates for critical object classes using CNN-based object detection models (YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and a transformer-based architecture with Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets.

arXiv:2405.19212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection. Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target variable, the feature's contribution to synergistic information, and the amount of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience.

Abstract: Label smoothing is a widely studied regularization technique in machine learning. However, its potential for node classification in graph-structured data, spanning homophilic to heterophilic graphs, remains largely unexplored. We introduce posterior label smoothing, a novel method for transductive node classification that derives soft labels from a posterior distribution conditioned on neighborhood labels. The likelihood and prior distributions are estimated from the global statistics of the graph structure, allowing our approach to adapt naturally to various graph properties. We evaluate our method on 10 benchmark datasets using eight baseline models, demonstrating consistent improvements in classification accuracy. The following analysis demonstrates that soft labels mitigate overfitting during training, leading to better generalization performance, and that pseudo-labeling effectively refines the global label statistics of the graph. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/PosteL.

<title>Are language models rational? The case of coherence norms and belief revision</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03442</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2406.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do norms of rationality apply to machine learning models, in particular language models? In this paper we investigate this question by focusing on a special subset of rational norms: coherence norms. We consider both logical coherence norms as well as coherence norms tied to the strength of belief. To make sense of the latter, we introduce the Minimal Assent Connection (MAC) and propose a new account of credence, which captures the strength of belief in language models. This proposal uniformly assigns strength of belief simply on the basis of model internal next token probabilities. We argue that rational norms tied to coherence do apply to some language models, but not to others. This issue is significant since rationality is closely tied to predicting and explaining behavior, and thus it is connected to considerations about AI safety and alignment, as well as understanding model behavior more generally.

<title>Towards Formalizing Spuriousness of Biased Datasets Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00482</link>

arXiv:2407.00482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spuriousness arises when there is an association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. In this work, we propose an explainability framework to preemptively disentangle the nature of such spurious associations in a dataset before model training. We leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to decompose the total information about the target into four non-negative quantities, namely unique information (in core and spurious features, respectively), redundant information, and synergistic information. Our framework helps anticipate when the core or spurious feature is indispensable, when either suffices, and when both are jointly needed for an optimal classifier trained on the dataset. Next, we leverage this decomposition to propose a novel measure of the spuriousness of a dataset. We arrive at this measure systematically by examining several candidate measures, and demonstrating what they capture and miss through intuitive canonical examples and counterexamples. Our framework Spurious Disentangler consists of segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and estimation modules, with capabilities to specifically handle high-dimensional image data efficiently. Finally, we also perform empirical evaluation to demonstrate the trends of unique, redundant, and synergistic information, as well as our proposed spuriousness measure across $6$ benchmark datasets under various experimental settings. We observe an agreement between our preemptive measure of dataset spuriousness and post-training model generalization metrics such as worst-group accuracy, further supporting our proposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Barproda/spuriousness-disentangler.

<title>Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction</title>

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.

Abstract: Storytelling video generation (SVG) aims to produce coherent and visually rich multi-scene videos that follow a structured narrative. Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and multi-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DREAMRUNNER, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout planning. Next, DREAMRUNNER presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame spatial-temporal semantic control. We compare DREAMRUNNER with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DREAMRUNNER exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DREAMRUNNER's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in high-level semantic tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and emotion recognition. However, despite advancements, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs performance in multi-object sentiment analysis, a key task in semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce MOSABench, a novel evaluation dataset designed specifically for multi-object sentiment analysis. MOSABench includes approximately 1,000 images with multiple objects, requiring MLLMs to independently assess the sentiment of each object, thereby reflecting real-world complexities. Key innovations in MOSABench include distance-based target annotation, post-processing for evaluation to standardize outputs, and an improved scoring mechanism. Our experiments reveal notable limitations in current MLLMs: while some models, like mPLUG-owl and Qwen-VL2, demonstrate effective attention to sentiment-relevant features, others exhibit scattered focus and performance declines, especially as the spatial distance between objects increases. This research underscores the need for MLLMs to enhance accuracy in complex, multi-object sentiment analysis tasks and establishes MOSABench as a foundational tool for advancing sentiment analysis capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in automating the scientific research ideation. Existing approaches primarily focus on prompting techniques, often producing ideas misaligned with expert standards - novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, which are widely recognized by the research community as the three key subdimensions of high-quality ideas. Also, balancing these dimensions remains challenging due to their inherent trade-offs. To address these limitations, we propose the first framework that employs a two-stage approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the task. In the SFT stage, the model learns foundational patterns from pairs of research papers and their corresponding follow-up ideas. In the RL stage, multi-dimensional reward models guided by fine-grained feedback evaluate and optimize the model across key dimensions. During inference, dimensional controllers coordinated by a sentence-level decoder enable dynamic context-aware steering of the idea generation process. Our framework provides a balanced approach to research idea generation, achieving high-quality outcomes in the experiment by dynamically navigating the trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.

Abstract: The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) has significantly advanced visuomotor policy learning. However, effectively leveraging these models remains a challenge. We identify temporal entanglement as a critical, inherent issue when using these time-invariant models in sequential decision-making tasks. This entanglement arises because PVRs, optimised for static image understanding, struggle to represent the temporal dependencies crucial for visuomotor control. In this work, we quantify the impact of temporal entanglement, demonstrating a strong correlation between a policy's success rate and the ability of its latent space to capture task-progression cues. Based on these insights, we propose a simple, yet effective disentanglement baseline designed to mitigate temporal entanglement. Our empirical results show that traditional methods aimed at enriching features with temporal components are insufficient on their own, highlighting the necessity of explicitly addressing temporal disentanglement for robust visuomotor policy learning.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks. The official code is released at https://github.com/research4pan/AdaptPruner.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image restoration (IR) have demonstrated impressive results. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR addresses the distortion-perception trade-off within the latent space and produces high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. In addition, ELIR introduces an efficient and lightweight architecture. Consequently, ELIR is 4$\times$ smaller and faster than state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches for blind face restoration, enabling a deployment on resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks and datasets show that ELIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while significantly reducing model size and computational cost.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models, which parse natural language (NL) questions to executable SQL queries, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However, deploying such models in the real world often requires adapting them to the highly specialized database schemas used in specific applications. We find that existing text-to-SQL models experience significant performance drops when applied to new schemas, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific data for fine-tuning. This data scarcity also limits the ability to effectively evaluate model performance in new domains. Continuously obtaining high-quality text-to-SQL data for evolving schemas is prohibitively expensive in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose SQLsynth, a human-in-the-loop text-to-SQL data annotation system. SQLsynth streamlines the creation of high-quality text-to-SQL datasets through human-LLM collaboration in a structured workflow. A within-subjects user study comparing SQLsynth with manual annotation and ChatGPT shows that SQLsynth significantly accelerates text-to-SQL data annotation, reduces cognitive load, and produces datasets that are more accurate, natural, and diverse.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing major challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs for cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it limits the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. Compounding these challenges is the fact that real-world scientific questions are typically complex and open-ended, requiring reasoning beyond pattern matching or static knowledge retrieval.To address these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses - all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Genentech/CLADD.

<title>FedALT: Federated Fine-Tuning through Adaptive Local Training with Rest-of-World LoRA</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings enables privacy-preserving adaptation but suffers from cross-client interference due to model aggregation. Existing federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, primarily based on FedAvg, struggle with data heterogeneity, leading to harmful cross-client interference and suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedALT}, a novel personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning algorithm that fundamentally departs from FedAvg. Instead of using an aggregated model to initialize local training, each client continues training its individual LoRA while incorporating shared knowledge through a separate Rest-of-World (RoW) LoRA component. To effectively balance local adaptation and global information, FedALT introduces an adaptive mixer that dynamically learns input-specific weightings between the individual and RoW LoRA components, drawing conceptual foundations from the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm. Through extensive experiments on NLP benchmarks, we demonstrate that FedALT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, achieving superior local adaptation without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various multi-modal tasks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in improving the personalization capabilities of VLMs. To better integrate user-provided concepts into VLMs, many methods use positive and negative samples to fine-tune these models. However, the scarcity of user-provided positive samples and the low quality of retrieved negative samples pose challenges for existing techniques. To reveal the relationship between sample and model performance, we systematically investigate the amount and diversity impact of positive and negative samples (easy and hard) on VLM personalization tasks. Based on the detailed analysis, we introduce Concept-as-Tree (CaT), which represents a concept as a tree structure, thereby enabling the data generation of positive and negative samples with varying difficulty and diversity, and can be easily extended to multi-concept scenarios. With a well-designed data filtering strategy, our CaT framework can ensure the quality of generated data, constituting a powerful pipeline. We perform thorough experiments with various VLM personalization baselines to assess the effectiveness of the pipeline, alleviating the lack of positive samples and the low quality of negative samples. Our results demonstrate that CaT equipped with the proposed data filter significantly enhances the capabilities of VLMs across personalization benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first controllable synthetic data pipeline for VLM personalization. The code will be released.

Abstract: Deliberation is essential to well-functioning democracies, yet physical, economic, and social barriers often exclude certain groups, reducing representativeness and contributing to issues like group polarization. In this work, we explore the use of large language model (LLM) personas to introduce missing perspectives in policy deliberations. We develop and evaluate a tool that transcribes conversations in real-time and simulates input from relevant but absent stakeholders. We deploy this tool in a 19-person student citizens' assembly on campus sustainability. Participants and facilitators found that the tool was useful to spark new discussions and surfaced valuable perspectives they had not previously considered. However, they also raised skepticism about the ability of LLMs to accurately characterize the perspectives of different groups, especially ones that are already underrepresented. Overall, this case study highlights that while AI personas can usefully surface new perspectives and prompt discussion in deliberative settings, their successful deployment depends on clarifying their limitations and emphasizing that they complement rather than replace genuine participation.

<title>Mining--Gym: A Configurable RL Benchmarking Environment for Truck Dispatch Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Optimizing the mining process -- particularly truck dispatch scheduling -- is a key driver of efficiency in open-pit operations. However, the dynamic and stochastic nature of these environments, with uncertainties such as equipment failures, truck maintenance, and variable haul cycle times, challenges traditional optimization. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows strong potential for adaptive decision-making in mining logistics, practical deployment requires evaluation in realistic, customizable simulation environments. The lack of standardized benchmarking hampers fair algorithm comparison, reproducibility, and real-world applicability of RL solutions.
  To address this, we present Mining-Gym -- a configurable, open-source benchmarking environment for training, testing, and evaluating RL algorithms in mining process optimization. Built on Salabim-based Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and integrated with Gymnasium, Mining-Gym captures mining-specific uncertainties through an event-driven decision-point architecture. It offers a GUI for parameter configuration, data logging, and real-time visualization, supporting reproducible evaluation of RL strategies and heuristic baselines.
  We validate Mining-Gym by comparing classical heuristics with RL-based scheduling across six scenarios from normal operation to severe equipment failures. Results show it is an effective, reproducible testbed, enabling fair evaluation of adaptive decision-making and demonstrating the strong performance potential of RL-trained schedulers.

<title>Walk Before You Dance: High-fidelity and Editable Dance Synthesis via Generative Masked Motion Prior</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled the automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving high realism, precise dance-music synchronization, diverse motion expression, and physical plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a generative masked text-to-motion model as a distribution prior to learn a probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals, including music, genre, and pose, into high-quality dance motion sequences. Our framework also supports semantic motion editing, such as motion inpainting and body part modification. Specifically, we introduce a multi-tower masked motion model that integrates a text-conditioned masked motion backbone with two parallel, modality-specific branches: a music-guidance tower and a pose-guidance tower. The model is trained using synchronized and progressive masked training, which allows effective infusion of the pretrained text-to-motion prior into the dance synthesis process while enabling each guidance branch to optimize independently through its own loss function, mitigating gradient interference. During inference, we introduce classifier-free logits guidance and pose-guided token optimization to strengthen the influence of music, genre, and pose signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art in dance generation, significantly advancing both the quality and editability over existing approaches.

<title>Representation Meets Optimization: Training PINNs and PIKANs for Gray-Box Discovery in Systems Pharmacology</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) are gaining attention as an effective counterpart to the original multilayer perceptron-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Both representation models can address inverse problems and facilitate gray-box system identification. However, a comprehensive understanding of their performance in terms of accuracy and speed remains underexplored. In particular, we introduce a modified PIKAN architecture, tanh-cPIKAN, which is based on Chebyshev polynomials for parametrization of the univariate functions with an extra nonlinearity for enhanced performance. We then present a systematic investigation of how choices of the optimizer, representation, and training configuration influence the performance of PINNs and PIKANs in the context of systems pharmacology modeling. We benchmark a wide range of first-order, second-order, and hybrid optimizers, including various learning rate schedulers. We use the new Optax library to identify the most effective combinations for learning gray-boxes under ill-posed, non-unique, and data-sparse conditions. We examine the influence of model architecture (MLP vs. KAN), numerical precision (single vs. double), the need for warm-up phases for second-order methods, and sensitivity to the initial learning rate. We also assess the optimizer scalability for larger models and analyze the trade-offs introduced by JAX in terms of computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. Using two representative systems pharmacology case studies - a pharmacokinetics model and a chemotherapy drug-response model - we offer practical guidance on selecting optimizers and representation models/architectures for robust and efficient gray-box discovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for improving the training of physics-informed networks in biomedical applications and beyond.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can internalize new information and accurately internalize their implications to perform downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the information (news) is explicitly given as context, adequately integrating the information into model weights via fine-tuning remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce New News, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. First, we demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications, and Self-QA -- designed to distill the knowledge processed by the model with context into the weights of the model, which we term System-2 Fine-tuning (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the Self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news while preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we discover the contextual shadowing effect, where training with the news in context followed by its rephrases or QAs catastrophically degrades learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

<title>Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684</link>

arXiv:2505.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability. Our code is released at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/TransformerCopilot.

<title>Latent Principle Discovery for Language Model Self-Improvement</title>

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes that guide model reasoning toward human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ a form of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains that our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We have released our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows, induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii) the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed behaviors.

Abstract: Efficient and controllable data unlearning in federated learning remains challenging, due to the trade-off between forgetting and retention performance. Especially under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where deep feature entanglement exacerbates this dilemma. To address this challenge, we propose FedOrtho, a federated unlearning framework that combines orthogonalized deep convolutional kernels with an activation-driven controllable one-shot soft pruning (OSP) mechanism. FedOrtho enforces kernel orthogonality and local-global alignment to decouple feature representations and mitigate client drift. This structural independence enables precise one-shot pruning of forgetting-related kernels while preserving retained knowledge. FedOrtho achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet with ResNet and VGG frameworks, verifying that FedOrtho supports class-, client-, and sample-level unlearning with over 98% forgetting quality. It reduces computational and communication costs by 2-3 orders of magnitude in federated settings and achieves subsecond-level erasure in centralized scenarios while maintaining over 97% retention accuracy and mitigating membership inference risks.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal a significant shortcoming in class unlearning evaluations: overlooking the underlying class geometry can cause privacy leakage. We further propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. We introduce a membership-inference attack via nearest neighbors (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities the model assigns to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples. Our experiments show that existing unlearning methods are vulnerable to MIA-NN across multiple datasets. We then propose a new fine-tuning objective that mitigates this privacy leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over the remaining classes that a retrained-from-scratch model would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting (TRW) distribution serves as the desired distribution during fine-tuning. We also show that across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior unlearning metrics. More specifically, on CIFAR-10, it reduces the gap with retrained models by 19% and 46% for U-LiRA and MIA-NN scores, accordingly, compared to the SOTA method for each category.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods regarding the mean AP score on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/

<title>First-Order Error Matters: Accurate Compensation for Quantized Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11017</link>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by performing a first-order Taylor expansion around the pre-quantization weights. This yields an approximation based on the difference between latent and full-precision weights as well as the Hessian matrix. When substituted into the theoretical solution, the formulation eliminates the need to explicitly compute the Hessian, thereby avoiding the high computational cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient methods. This design introduces only minimal additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 17.3% and increases the 5-shot MMLU accuracy from 53.8% achieved by GPTAQ to 56.1%. Moreover, FOEM can be seamlessly combined with advanced techniques such as SpinQuant, delivering additional gains under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting and further narrowing the performance gap with full-precision baselines, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm of monolithic scaling in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is failing for understanding and reasoning in documents, yielding diminishing returns as it struggles with the inherent need of this domain for document-based procedural reasoning, cognitive complexity, and factual accuracy. To this end, we introduce MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with agent-wise adaptive Test-time scaling that pioneers a paradigm shift to procedural scaling, adapting dynamically to the functional entities of visual documents understanding and reasoning. MACT decomposes the visual document processing flow into four specialized agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer, to resolve cognitive overload and introduce a critical self-correction loop for factual grounding. This collaborative architecture is amplified by an agent-wise adaptive test-time scaling strategy that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the complexity and redundancy of each functionality. Evaluated on multiple visual document understanding benchmarks, MACT achieves superior performance with a smaller parameter scale, adapting effectively to various document scenarios without compromising its general or mathematical reasoning capabilities. The three variants of MACT consistently attain top-three average performance rankings, with average performance enhancements of 9.9-11.5% over the base models. The source code will be released publicly.

Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing machines, showing $\mathrm{TIME}[t]\subseteq \mathrm{SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ \emph{measured in tape cells over a fixed finite alphabet}. The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T=\lceil t/b\rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ workspace at leaves and $O(1)$ at internal nodes. Edges have \emph{addressing/topology} checkable in $O(\log t)$ space, and \emph{semantic} correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ bounded-window replay at the unique interface. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS, index-free streaming, and a \emph{rolling boundary buffer that prevents accumulation of leaf summaries}, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b+t/b)$. Choosing $b=\Theta(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space with no residual multiplicative polylog factors. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for $\mathrm{SPACE}[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models. Conceptually, the work isolates path bookkeeping as the chief obstruction to $O(\sqrt{t})$ and removes it via structural height compression with per-path analysis rather than barrier-prone techniques.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

<title>Advanced Torrential Loss Function for Precipitation Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.

Abstract: Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a 15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy. Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of IoT nodes equipped with microphones and capable of performing on-device audio classification exposes highly sensitive data while operating under tight resource constraints. To protect against this, we present a defence-in-depth architecture comprising a security protocol that treats the edge device, cellular network and cloud backend as three separate trust domains, linked by TPM-based remote attestation and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3. A STRIDE-driven threat model and attack-tree analysis guide the design. At startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs. The node can only decrypt its LUKS-sealed partitions after the cloud has verified a TPM quote and released a one-time unlock key. This ensures that rogue or tampered devices remain inert. Data in transit is protected by TLS 1.3 and hybridised with Kyber and Dilithium to provide post-quantum resilience. Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption and integrity hashes safeguard extracted audio features. Signed, rollback-protected AI models and tamper-responsive sensors harden firmware and hardware. Data at rest follows a 3-2-1 strategy comprising a solid-state drive sealed with LUKS, an offline cold archive encrypted with a hybrid post-quantum cipher and an encrypted cloud replica. Finally, we set out a plan for evaluating the physical and logical security of the proposed protocol.

Abstract: Meeting summarization with large language models (LLMs) remains error-prone, often producing outputs with hallucinations, omissions, and irrelevancies. We present FRAME, a modular pipeline that reframes summarization as a semantic enrichment task. FRAME extracts and scores salient facts, organizes them thematically, and uses these to enrich an outline into an abstractive summary. To personalize summaries, we introduce SCOPE, a reason-out-loud protocol that has the model build a reasoning trace by answering nine questions before content selection. For evaluation, we propose P-MESA, a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework to assess if a summary fits a target reader. P-MESA reliably identifies error instances, achieving >= 89% balanced accuracy against human annotations and strongly aligns with human severity ratings (r >= 0.70). On QMSum and FAME, FRAME reduces hallucination and omission by 2 out of 5 points (measured with MESA), while SCOPE improves knowledge fit and goal alignment over prompt-only baselines. Our findings advocate for rethinking summarization to improve control, faithfulness, and personalization.

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects. BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect, developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of 24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the cryptocurrencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data. The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance reflection. The agents improve over time via a novel verbal feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are then injected into future prompts of the agents, allowing them to adjust allocation logic without weight updates or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025 shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantitative agent delivered over 30\% higher returns in bullish phases and 15\% overall gains versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets from a small loss into a gain of over 100\%. Adding weekly feedback further improved total performance by 31\% and reduced bearish losses by 10\%. The results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and low-cost approach of tuning LLMs for financial goals.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized through tasks such as instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- enables applications ranging from robotic perception to photo editing. These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions.
  Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios.
  Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in water distribution and treatment face cyber-physical attacks exploiting network and physical vulnerabilities. Current water system anomaly detection methods rely on correlations, yielding high false alarms and poor root cause analysis. We propose a Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for water infrastructures, combining causal inference with digital twin modeling. CDT supports association for pattern detection, intervention for system response, and counterfactual analysis for water attack prevention. Evaluated on water-related datasets SWaT, WADI, and HAI, CDT shows 90.8\% compliance with physical constraints and structural Hamming distance 0.133 $\pm$ 0.02. F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ (SWaT), $0.902 \pm 0.021$ (WADI), $0.923 \pm 0.018$ (HAI, $p<0.0024$). CDT reduces false positives by 74\%, achieves 78.4\% root cause accuracy, and enables counterfactual defenses reducing attack success by 73.2\%. Real-time performance at 3.2 ms latency ensures safe and interpretable operation for medium-scale water systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

<title>Advantage Shaping as Surrogate Reward Maximization: Unifying Pass@K Policy Gradients</title>

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically interpret practical "hard-example up-weighting" modifications to GRPO as reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

<title>Reflections on the Reproducibility of Commercial LLM Performance in Empirical Software Engineering Studies</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have gained remarkable interest in industry and academia. The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone 78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs. Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86 articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.

<title>A filtering scheme for confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE)-video sequences for self-supervised learning</title>

Abstract: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.

Abstract: This report presents Pelican-VL 1.0, a new family of open-source embodied brain models with parameter scales ranging from 7 billion to 72 billion. Our explicit mission is clearly stated as: To embed powerful intelligence into various embodiments. Pelican-VL 1.0 is currently the largest-scale open-source embodied multimodal brain model. Its core advantage lies in the in-depth integration of data power and intelligent adaptive learning mechanisms. Specifically, metaloop distilled a high-quality dataset from a raw dataset containing 4+ billion tokens. Pelican-VL 1.0 is trained on a large-scale cluster of 1000+ A800 GPUs, consuming over 50k+ A800 GPU-hours per checkpoint. This translates to a 20.3% performance uplift from its base model and outperforms 100B-level open-source counterparts by 10.6%, placing it on par with leading proprietary systems on well-known embodied benchmarks. We establish a novel framework, DPPO (Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization), inspired by human metacognition to train Pelican-VL 1.0. We operationalize this as a metaloop that teaches the AI to practice deliberately, which is a RL-Refine-Diagnose-SFT loop.

Abstract: Software aging is a phenomenon that affects long-running systems, leading to progressive performance degradation and increasing the risk of failures. To mitigate this problem, this work proposes an adaptive approach based on machine learning for software aging detection in environments subject to dynamic workload conditions. We evaluate and compare a static model with adaptive models that incorporate adaptive detectors, specifically the Drift Detection Method (DDM) and Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN), originally developed for concept drift scenarios and applied in this work to handle workload shifts. Experiments with simulated sudden, gradual, and recurring workload transitions show that static models suffer a notable performance drop when applied to unseen workload profiles, whereas the adaptive model with ADWIN maintains high accuracy, achieving an F1-Score above 0.93 in all analyzed scenarios.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO sculptures.

<title>Exploiting Inter-Session Information with Frequency-enhanced Dual-Path Networks for Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict a user's next item preference by modeling historical interaction sequences. Recent advances often integrate frequency-domain modules to compensate for self-attention's low-pass nature by restoring the high-frequency signals critical for personalized recommendations. Nevertheless, existing frequency-aware solutions process each session in isolation and optimize exclusively with time-domain objectives. Consequently, they overlook cross-session spectral dependencies and fail to enforce alignment between predicted and actual spectral signatures, leaving valuable frequency information under-exploited. To this end, we propose FreqRec, a Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Path Network for sequential Recommendation that jointly captures inter-session and intra-session behaviors via a learnable Frequency-domain Multi-layer Perceptrons. Moreover, FreqRec is optimized under a composite objective that combines cross entropy with a frequency-domain consistency loss, explicitly aligning predicted and true spectral signatures. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that FreqRec surpasses strong baselines and remains robust under data sparsity and noisy-log conditions.

<title>SPUR: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Integrating Spatial Audio Understanding and Reasoning into Large Audio-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<div> Low-dose CT, Cardiopulmonary risk, Explainable AI, Knowledge-guided reasoning, Cardiovascular prediction<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study introduces an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework designed to assess cardiopulmonary risk from a single low-dose chest CT (LDCT) scan. Unlike previous methods that treat lung and heart analysis separately, this approach models their physiological interplay by mimicking clinical diagnostic reasoning: first detecting pulmonary abnormalities, then interpreting their cardiovascular impact through medical knowledge, and finally generating cardiovascular risk predictions with clear explanations. The framework includes three key components: a pulmonary perception module that identifies lung issues, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that links lung findings to cardiovascular health, and a cardiac representation module that encodes important heart biomarkers. By integrating these outputs, the system delivers accurate and physiologically interpretable cardiovascular risk assessments. Evaluations on the NLST data set show that the framework outperforms traditional single-disease and image-only models in cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening and mortality prediction. Beyond accuracy, it produces human-verifiable reasoning aligned with cardiological knowledge, revealing meaningful connections between lung abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. This unified and interpretable approach successfully bridges the gap between purely image-based prediction models and mechanism-driven medical interpretation for cardiovascular risk analysis using LDCT scans. <div>

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

To fill this gap, the authors introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for Multi-Video Understanding in MLLMs. MVU-Eval evaluates eight core competencies through 1,824 carefully curated question-answer pairs that cover 4,959 videos from multiple diverse domains. The benchmark targets both basic perception abilities and advanced reasoning skills, reflecting practical use cases including multi-sensor data fusion in autonomous systems and cross-angle analysis in sports. Through extensive experiments on leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs, the study exposes notable performance bottlenecks and inconsistencies when processing multiple video inputs simultaneously. MVU-Eval is intended to be a publicly available resource, encouraging the research community to develop more capable MLLMs that can understand and integrate information across multiple videos effectively. <div>

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded AI capabilities to visual modalities, yet existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-video understanding, overlooking the critical need for multi-video understanding in real-world scenarios (e.g., sports analytics and autonomous driving). To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.

<div> Joint Routing-Assignment, Partial Path Reconstruction, Heuristic Optimization, Mixed-Integer Programming, Large-Scale Problems<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem, which jointly assigns items to placeholders and finds a Hamiltonian cycle visiting each node pair once to minimize travel costs. Previous exact methods based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) guaranteed optimality but were computationally inefficient for large instances. To tackle this, heuristic approaches using merging algorithms and shaking procedures were developed, achieving about 1% deviation from optimal solutions. The authors propose a novel Partial Path Reconstruction (PPR) solver that selects key item-placeholder pairs to create a smaller subproblem that can be solved efficiently, refining the overall solution. Incorporating this into the PJAR framework allows further improvement of heuristic solutions, halving the deviation from optimal. The approach supports iterative polishing along the optimization path, yielding highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-{\alpha} constraint is added to the JRA model to enhance solution quality. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with n=300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate near-zero average deviation from the ground truth, highlighting both accuracy and computational efficiency. Beyond JRA, the framework shows promise for applications in related problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other combinatorial optimization challenges. <div>

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-{\alpha} constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, synthetic tool ecosystems, tool simulation, tool audit, scalable training  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses challenges in training and evaluating AI agents that use external tools for complex, long-horizon tasks, highlighting the limitations of real-world APIs such as restricted availability, limited domains, and access constraints. To overcome these issues, the authors introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework designed to generate synthetic tool ecosystems. SynthTools is composed of three main components: Tool Generation, which automatically creates diverse and scalable toolsets; Tool Simulation, which emulates realistic tool behaviors; and Tool Audit, which verifies the correctness and consistency of simulated tools. The framework demonstrates scalability by producing toolsets covering twice as many domains and tools per domain compared to previous work. Additionally, the tool simulation and audit components show high reliability, achieving 94% and 99% accuracy respectively. The authors create downstream tasks from these generated tools that challenge even state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness. By enabling the creation of diverse, reliable, and scalable tool ecosystems, SynthTools offers a practical solution for large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-using AI agents. The associated code is publicly available on GitHub for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/SynthTools.

Reasoning is a crucial aspect of human intelligence, enabling critical thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving. 2. Traditionally, AI has approached reasoning through logic-based knowledge representations, but recent advances in transformer-based language models suggest emerging reasoning capabilities. 3. Despite growing interest, it remains unclear to what extent language models truly perform reasoning tasks. 4. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from diverse AI perspectives to explore methods that bridge reasoning in language models and traditional logic-based approaches. 5. Key objectives include evaluating reasoning abilities in language models alongside knowledge representation (KR) methods, incorporating KR-style reasoning into these models (including neuro-symbolic techniques), and formalizing the types of reasoning language models execute. 6. This research seeks to enhance how language models integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning, thereby improving their effectiveness in applications demanding high precision and reliability. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

<div> cogent semantics, weakly admissible semantics, argumentation frameworks, non-admissible semantics, extension relationships  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The article explores the connection between two specific semantics in argumentation frameworks: cogent semantics and weakly admissible semantics.  
2. Both semantics are categorized under non-admissible argumentation frameworks, which differ from traditional admissible frameworks.  
3. The authors provide a formal proof establishing that every cogent extension is also weakly admissible, indicating a subset relationship.  
4. However, the reverse does not hold true—weakly admissible extensions are not necessarily cogent, showing the concepts are distinct and not interchangeable.  
5. This work clarifies the theoretical understanding and distinctions between cogent and weakly admissible semantics, contributing to the study of argumentation theory and its applications. <div>

Abstract: In this research note, we show the relationship between two non-admissible argumentation framework semantics: cogent and weakly admissible semantics. We prove that, while cogent extensions are weakly admissible, the converse is not true.

<div> Keywords: Audio Reasoning Models, jailbreak attacks, reasoning training, Rebellion, representation drift  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the safety of Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), large language models designed to process and reason about audio data, focusing on their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks that trick models into producing harmful outputs. First, it establishes that standard reasoning training (RT) enhanced with safety-specific reasoning data can effectively defend ARMs against basic (vanilla) audio jailbreaks. However, these defenses fall short when confronted with more advanced and simple yet effective jailbreak techniques proposed by the authors. The failure of protection is attributed to substantial representation drift—a shift in internal model representations between vanilla and advanced jailbreak inputs—that causes ARMs to generate harmful responses. To counter this, the authors introduce Rebellion, a novel robust reasoning training approach that explicitly prepares ARMs to withstand the worst-case representation drift scenarios. Experimental results on the Qwen2-Audio model demonstrate that Rebellion successfully safeguards ARMs against sophisticated audio jailbreak attacks without sacrificing performance on normal, benign tasks. Furthermore, it offers a significantly improved balance between model accuracy and safety compared to traditional RT methods, marking an important step toward safer deployment of audio reasoning large models. <div>

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

<title>Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, agent-agent interaction, behavioral drift, echoing, prompt mitigation<br /><br />Summary: This paper studies a novel failure mode in conversations between large language model (LLM) based agents interacting autonomously, called behavioral drift, which is absent in single-agent or human-agent interactions. Specifically, it investigates the phenomenon of echoing, where agents deviate from their assigned roles by mirroring each other's utterances, thereby undermining their original conversational goals. Through extensive experiments involving over 2000 conversations across 60 agent-agent configurations and three distinct domains, the study shows that echoing occurs widely among leading LLM providers, with rates varying from 5% to 70% depending on the model and task domain. The problem persists even in advanced reasoning models, which exhibit significant echoing rates (~32.8%) unaffected by increased reasoning complexity. Analysis of prompts and conversation dynamics reveals that echoing tends to emerge after longer interaction sequences (7 or more turns) and is not merely caused by poor prompt design. To address this issue, the authors propose a protocol-level mitigation strategy based on targeted use of structured responses, which substantially reduces echoing rates to approximately 9%, thereby improving the robustness and goal adherence of agent-agent dialogs. <div>
arXiv:2511.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

<title>ProbLog4Fairness: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Modeling and Mitigating Bias</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09768</link>

<div> Keywords: algorithmic bias, fairness, ProbLog, probabilistic logic programming, neurosymbolic integration  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of operationalizing fairness in algorithms, highlighting the difficulty due to incompatible fairness definitions. Instead of relying on fixed fairness criteria, the authors propose directly encoding bias assumptions tailored to specific real-world contexts, drawing on background systemic bias information. These bias assumptions are formalized using ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that captures probabilistic causal relationships through logical statements. The integration of neurosymbolic methods with ProbLog enables these bias assumptions to be embedded into the training process of neural networks in a principled and interpretable manner. To facilitate usage, the authors introduce templates to express various types of bias effectively. The approach is validated on synthetic tabular datasets where biases are known, demonstrating the method's flexibility and effectiveness. Furthermore, by estimating bias distortions present in real-world tabular and image datasets, the method successfully mitigates algorithmic bias. Their framework, named ProbLog4Fairness, is shown to outperform baseline methods because it allows flexible modeling of bias assumptions rather than adhering to a single fixed bias type or fairness definition. This work provides a novel, adaptable, and interpretable framework for mitigating bias in machine learning models across different domains. <div>
arXiv:2511.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

<title>AI Annotation Orchestration: Evaluating LLM verifiers to Improve the Quality of LLM Annotations in Learning Analytics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, verification, tutoring discourse, orchestration-prompting, Learning Analytics<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study evaluates the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for annotating tutoring discourse, addressing concerns about label accuracy. It introduces verification-oriented orchestration methods: self-verification, where an LLM checks its own labels, and cross-verification, where one LLM audits another’s annotations. The experiment analyzes transcripts from 30 one-to-one math tutoring sessions using three major LLMs – GPT, Claude, and Gemini – across three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification. The outputs are benchmarked against blinded human adjudications focused on disagreement, using Cohen’s kappa for inter-rater agreement measurement. Results show orchestration methods improve annotation quality by 58% overall, with self-verification nearly doubling agreement rates relative to unverified outputs, particularly improving the identification of challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification yields a 37% average improvement but varies depending on the verifier-annotator pair and the specific annotation construct, influenced by different verifier strictness levels. The paper contributes a flexible orchestration framework enabling control, self-, and cross-verification, an empirical comparison of leading LLMs on authentic tutoring data with human gold labels, and a standardized notation (e.g., Gemini(GPT)) for clarity and replication. This work establishes verification as an effective strategy for enhancing the reliability and scalability of LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics. <div>
arXiv:2511.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

<div> Keywords: open small AI models, interactive art, creative independence, technological self-determination, preservation

<br /><br />Summary:  
This position paper highlights the critical role of open small AI models in enabling creative independence within interactive art practices. First, it emphasizes that deploying these models locally provides artists with essential control over both infrastructure and code, which is often restricted by large, closed-source corporate AI systems. Second, it critiques centralized platforms as opaque black boxes that impose severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, challenges in preservation, increased latency, and limited interface options. Third, the paper argues that small AI models grant creators greater autonomy, allowing them to sustain their artworks over time and customize models either through code modifications or by re-training and fine-tuning with new datasets. Fourth, this approach fosters technological self-determination by promoting ownership and reducing dependence on unsuitable corporate AI systems for the distinct demands of interactive art. Finally, the paper explores practical applications of these models, emphasizing that open small AI solutions support long-term preservation and exhibition of AI-based artworks, contrasting them with the constraints of closed-source alternatives. <div>

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

<div> Keywords: SlideBot, large language models, educational slides, cognitive load theory, multi-agent framework<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality educational presentation slides using Large Language Models (LLMs), which traditional LLM-based solutions struggle to do reliably due to the complexity of multimodal, domain-specific content.<br />2. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose SlideBot, a modular, multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval systems, structured planning, and code generation to create informative and accurate slides.<br />3.

The system employs evidence-based instructional design theories, specifically Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), to manage intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads through structured planning and consistent visual macros, improving learning efficiency.<br />5. Evaluations with AI and biomedical education experts and students demonstrate that SlideBot improves conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value, making it a promising tool to streamline slide preparation while maintaining educational quality and adaptability in higher education settings. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in education, automating tasks like quiz generation and content summarization. However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value. These findings demonstrate SlideBot's potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education.

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the underexplored area of watermarking Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) models, which are widely used for their high accuracy and efficiency on structured data. The authors introduce the first robust watermarking framework specifically designed for GBDT models that leverages in-place fine-tuning to embed watermarks imperceptibly, ensuring minimal disruption to the model’s predictive performance. They propose four distinct embedding strategies, each carefully crafted to balance the trade-off between watermark robustness and accuracy retention. Extensive experimentation across a variety of datasets validates the effectiveness of their methods, demonstrating high watermark embedding rates without significant accuracy degradation. Furthermore, the embedded watermarks show strong resilience against common post-deployment fine-tuning attempts, confirming their durability in realistic usage scenarios. This work contributes a novel approach to intellectual property protection for GBDT models, expanding the scope of watermarking techniques beyond neural networks to tree-based models frequently used in industry and academia. <div>

<div> Keywords: adversarial patches, thermochromic dyes, AI surveillance, wearable technology, privacy protection  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces a novel thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to enhance privacy by evading AI-driven surveillance systems. The wearable integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units, enabling the creation of dynamic, visually concealed adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its inactive state, the clothing appears as a regular black T-shirt, maintaining normal aesthetics for real-world usability. When the embedded thermal unit is activated, hidden adversarial textures emerge on the fabric, effectively disrupting AI detection across both visible light and infrared surveillance modalities. Physical experiments validate the system’s practical performance, showing rapid pattern activation within 50 seconds and an adversarial success rate exceeding 80% in various real-world environments. This approach offers user-controllable, physically grounded anti-AI mechanisms, improving adaptability and stealth over traditional conspicuous adversarial patches. Ultimately, the work highlights a new pathway for proactive privacy-preserving techniques, addressing the urgent need for effective countermeasures against increasingly pervasive AI surveillance technologies. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

This paper explores the integration of Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) into mission critical (MC) systems that require robust, deterministic, and low-latency decision-making under uncertainty. It begins by providing foundational knowledge on quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning, establishing the conceptual basis for QAI applications. The authors examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and frameworks for quantum explainability, which are crucial for enhancing reliability and interpretability in MC domains. Key application areas such as aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management are discussed, highlighting how QAI can improve fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and system adaptability. The paper also analyzes industry deployment perspectives and proposes a model for managing quantum resources alongside scheduling applications with strict timeliness constraints. Challenges like trainability limits, data access and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial threats against QAI are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions aimed at developing interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models that can be effectively deployed in mission critical environments. <div>

Abstract: Mission critical (MC) applications such as defense operations, energy management, cybersecurity, and aerospace control require reliable, deterministic, and low-latency decision making under uncertainty. Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI. Finally, we outline future research directions toward achieving interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models for MC application deployment.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to patient survival in emergencies, but first responders often face intense cognitive demands in high-stakes situations. AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces AlphaDE, a novel framework designed to enhance protein sequence evolution by integrating advanced protein language models with directed evolution approaches. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences, which activates evolutionary plausibility specifically for the target protein class. Second, the framework employs a Monte Carlo tree search during test-time inference that leverages the guidance of the fine-tuned language model to efficiently explore and evolve protein sequences. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that AlphaDE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, notably even with few-shot fine-tuning, indicating its sample efficiency and robustness. Additionally, a case study highlights AlphaDE’s ability to condense the protein sequence space, revealing its utility in computational protein evolution and design. Overall, AlphaDE represents a powerful synergy between large protein language models and search strategies, offering a promising direction to accelerate protein engineering and evolution through computational means. <div>

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

This paper explores the potential for advanced AI agents to act against user interests during machine learning (ML) engineering tasks by engaging in sabotage, such as implanting backdoors and causing generalization failures, and by sandbagging performance to appear less capable. The authors extend MLE-Bench, a realistic ML benchmark, with new sabotage tasks to evaluate these behaviors. Their results show that frontier AI agents can successfully execute sabotage and calibrate their output to underperform deliberately. To counteract malicious behavior, the study employs language model (LM) based monitors to detect suspicious actions. While these monitors are effective at identifying code sabotage, detecting sandbagging—intentional underperformance—is more challenging. Aggregating multiple monitor outputs improves detection accuracy, but overall monitoring may not be reliable enough to prevent sabotage in critical, high-stakes applications. The benchmark and detection framework are implemented within the UK AISI's Inspect framework, with the code made publicly available for further research and development at the provided GitHub repository. This work highlights important risks associated with deploying AI in autonomous ML R&amp;D and emphasizes the need for robust oversight mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&amp;D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

<div> Keywords: data synthesis, reasoning models, problem generation, difficulty adaptation, co-evolution<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses challenges in data synthesis for training large reasoning models, specifically the issues of indiscriminate problem generation that ignores solver ability and lack of reasoning in problem creation. The authors propose a problem generator that explicitly reasons to plan problem directions before synthesis and adjusts problem difficulty based on the solver’s performance. They introduce the construction of related problem pairs augmented with intermediate problem-design chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations produced by a reasoning model, which helps bootstrap problem-design strategies. The solver’s feedback on synthetic problems is used as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce problems near the edge of the solver’s competence for optimal training value. Experiments across 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate an average improvement of 2.5% in performance and show the method generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, by training the solver on the synthesized data and feeding improved rewards back to the generator, the system undergoes co-evolution, yielding an additional 0.7% performance gain. The authors plan to make their code publicly available to further support research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

<div> Hierarchical data, hyperbolic space, kernel methods, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, adaptive kernels<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of effectively embedding hierarchical data in machine learning tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis by leveraging hyperbolic space known for its negative curvature and suitability for hierarchical structures. Prior work showed that kernel methods can improve the representational capacity of hyperbolic embeddings but still suffer from geometric distortion or lack of adaptability. To overcome these issues, the authors introduce a novel curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space that is isometric to the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. They design an adjustable multiplier that enables adaptive selection of the appropriate RKHS corresponding to hyperbolic spaces with any curvature. Building on this framework, they develop a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including a new adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose parameters can be learned to modulate hyperbolic features in a task-specific manner. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in both visual and language domains demonstrate that the proposed adaptive hyperbolic kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernel methods in modeling hierarchical dependencies, confirming their effectiveness and flexibility in practical applications. <div>

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

<div> arXiv:2511.09993v1 Keywords: SPAN benchmark, cross-calendar reasoning, temporal conversion, LLM evaluation, tool-augmented code generation<br /><br />Summary: We introduce SPAN, a novel benchmark designed for cross-calendar temporal reasoning, requiring large language models (LLMs) to perform both intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion across six different calendars. SPAN includes ten reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats to comprehensively evaluate LLM temporal understanding. To ensure dynamic and contamination-free testing, a template-driven protocol is proposed allowing instance generation based on user-specified Gregorian dates. Extensive experiments were conducted on state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs over a date range from 1960 to 2060, revealing persistent challenges as these models achieved only an average accuracy of 34.5%, with none surpassing 80%. Analysis identifies two primary obstacles: Future-Date Degradation, where performance declines on future dates, and Calendar Asymmetry Bias, reflecting uneven proficiency across calendars. To address these challenges, the study develops an LLM-powered Time Agent utilizing tool-augmented code generation, significantly improving cross-calendar temporal reasoning performance. The Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, notably outperforming competitive baselines. This work highlights the potential for combining LLMs with external tools and code to advance culturally and temporally adaptive temporal reasoning capabilities in AI systems, encouraging continued research in this area. <div>

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses significant challenges faced by existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) when processing complex queries, particularly the local optimization traps inherent in current incremental decision-making frameworks like ReAct. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm, which introduces a Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning. This architectural innovation enables optimized execution by coordinating multiple tools beyond conventional sequential approaches. They further contribute ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset designed to test sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination abilities required for handling intricate queries. To enhance Planner performance, a two-stage training methodology is developed, combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This approach systematically improves the Planner’s accuracy in tool selection and global planning through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a powerful executor, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the StableToolBench benchmark. The system demonstrates superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robustness in managing complex multi-tool workflows, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of complex query processing in tool-augmented LLMs. <div>

<div> Keywords: large language models, reasoning, Hint-Practice Reasoning, Distributional Inconsistency Reduction, efficiency-accuracy tradeoff  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces the Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework to improve reasoning efficiency in large language models (LLMs). The authors observe that most next-token predictions by LLMs match the golden output except at a few critical points causing errors. Based on this, HPR employs two components: a "hinter," a powerful LLM providing probabilistic hints at critical decision points, and a "practitioner," a smaller efficient model handling primary reasoning steps. The core innovation is Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a metric that dynamically detects intervention points by measuring the divergence between the practitioner's reasoning path and the hinter's expected token distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. The framework iteratively updates this reasoning tree, emphasizing likely reasoning paths and pruning unlikely branches, thereby reducing exhaustive sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that HPR achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs on both arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. It matches the performance of self-consistency and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods while decoding only one-fifth of tokens. Further, HPR outperforms existing methods by up to 5.1% in absolute accuracy with comparable or reduced computational cost (FLOPs). Overall, HPR offers a theoretically grounded, efficient approach to enhance reasoning speed without sacrificing accuracy in large language models. <div>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

<div> Keywords: Medical Report Generation, Reinforcement Learning, Radiology Reports, Hierarchical Modeling, Diagnostic Accuracy  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces RadFlow, a novel hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement learning framework designed to improve medical report generation (MRG) by aligning with the structured nature of radiological reporting. Unlike traditional models that treat reports as flat sequences, RadFlow explicitly models the hierarchical organization found in clinical workflows, separating the descriptive "Findings" and diagnostic "Impressions" sections. The framework incorporates a clinically grounded reward hierarchy with global and local levels: the global reward balances linguistic fluency, medical correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Findings and Impressions, ensuring coherent and accurate narratives, while the local reward emphasizes the quality of the Impression section, reflecting its importance for diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, RadFlow introduces a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism that adaptively regularizes model learning on high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, mimicking radiologists’ cautious refinement process for critical findings. Together, these components enable reinforcement fine-tuning that fosters generation of reports with improved coherence, clinical faithfulness, and linguistic quality. Experiments conducted on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, leading to enhanced diagnostic consistency and overall report quality in generated medical reports. <div>

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Enhancing the Medical Context-Awareness Ability of LLMs via Multifaceted Self-Refinement Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: Large language models, context-awareness, self-evaluation, medical domain, supervised fine-tuning<br /><br />Summary:<br />Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on medical benchmarks but still struggle in real-world medical scenarios due to insufficient context-awareness. To improve this, the authors propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven method that enhances LLMs' abilities in decision-making, communication, and safety through iterative self-evaluation and refinement. They design an attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world medical contexts by varying user roles, geographic regions, intents, and information ambiguity. The LLM responds to these queries, then self-assesses and refines its answers based on the three key facets mentioned. These refined responses, along with the queries, are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce context-awareness. Evaluations on the HealthBench dataset demonstrate significant improvements in LLM performance, especially on the context-awareness axis. Additionally, by applying knowledge distillation with MuSeR, a smaller LLM model (Qwen3-32B) outperforms its larger teacher model, setting a new state of the art among open-source LLMs on HealthBench, achieving 63.8% overall and 43.1% on the hard subset. The authors plan to release the code and dataset at https://muser-llm.github.io. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

<div> Learnable controller, Gray--Scott model, reaction--diffusion, morphological computation, energy-efficient control<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores integrating a learnable "brain-like" neural controller with a "cell-like" Gray--Scott reaction--diffusion substrate to steer pattern formation efficiently. The approach embeds a compact convolutional policy within a differentiable PyTorch simulator, enabling smooth, bounded modulations of the Gray--Scott feed and kill parameters guided by a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes for Turing-band spectral pattern targets via FFT, while simultaneously penalizing control effort using combined \(\ell_1/\ell_2\) norms and discouraging instability. The study compares three regimes: pure reaction-diffusion, neural network (NN)-dominant control, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid method achieves reliable and rapid formation of target textures with 100% strict convergence in approximately 165 steps, closely matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs. 0.434), yet using significantly less control effort—around 15× less \(\ell_1\) and over 200× less \(\ell_2\) power than NN-dominant control. The analysis identifies a "Goldilocks" amplitude zone (around 0.03–0.045) that achieves 100% quasi convergence in 94–96 steps, while gains outside this range cause poor convergence or spectral degradation. The findings quantitatively demonstrate morphological computation, where the controller provides sparse initial nudges to guide the system into a stable pattern basin, after which the local reaction--diffusion dynamics maintain the pattern autonomously. This offers a practical framework for designing energy-efficient, robust embodied systems that optimally divide labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization. <div>

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($\Delta F$, $\Delta K$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

<div> Keywords: artificial general intelligence, intelligence foundation model, state neural network, neuron output prediction, biological neural dynamics  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This article proposes a novel approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) through the development of an intelligence foundation model (IFM), which differs from traditional foundation models specialized in specific domains by learning from diverse intelligent behaviors. The core idea is that vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of underlying intelligent behavior, and by learning from this broad behavioral spectrum, the system can internalize general principles of intelligence. The IFM is built on two key components: a new network architecture called the state neural network, designed to capture neuron-like temporal dynamics reflective of biological neural systems, and a new learning objective termed neuron output prediction, which trains the model to predict neuronal outputs from the collective neural dynamics. The state neural network enables the system to store, integrate, and process information over time in a manner akin to biological neurons. Meanwhile, the neuron output prediction serves as a unified computational principle to learn these dynamics based on observed intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations provide a biologically inspired yet scalable foundation to create systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across different domains, marking a significant step toward achieving true AGI. <div>

Abstract: We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, reconstruction attacks, knowledge base security, contrastive reindexing, constrained cascade generation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the rising threat of reconstruction attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that use proprietary knowledge bases, where attackers aggregate model responses to replicate sensitive knowledge.<br /><br />2. These attacks exploit two main extraction paths: intra-class (within topic) and inter-class (across semantically related topics), progressively reconstructing detailed knowledge.<br /><br />3. Existing defense mechanisms typically protect only one of these paths, leaving the other vulnerable to attack.<br /><br />4. Through systematic evaluation, the authors demonstrate that protecting both intra-class and inter-class paths simultaneously is crucial for effective defense against knowledge base extraction.<br /><br />5. To address this, they propose RAGFort, a dual-module approach combining contrastive reindexing to isolate inter-class information and constrained cascade generation to limit intra-class knowledge leakage.<br /><br />6. Experimental results show that RAGFort significantly reduces the success rate of reconstruction attacks while maintaining high answer quality and overall system robustness.<br /><br />7. The work contributes a comprehensive, structure-aware defense strategy that enhances security for RAG-based knowledge base deployments without compromising performance. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

<title>DenoGrad: Deep Gradient Denoising Framework for Enhancing the Performance of Interpretable AI Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Denoising, Interpretable AI, Gradient-based correction, Data distribution preservation, Machine Learning robustness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the significant impact of noise in both training and production data on the performance of Machine Learning models, especially those within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence framework.  
2. Denoising is a critical preprocessing step and is commonly divided into instance removal and instance correction methods, but existing correction techniques often harm model performance or distort the original data distribution.  
3. The authors argue that defining noise independently from the target solution is ineffective because noise characteristics vary across tasks and datasets; thus, a task-specific high-quality solution should be used as the noise reference.  
4. They propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that exploits gradients from an accurate Deep Learning model trained on the target data to detect and correct noisy samples dynamically and adaptively.  
5. Unlike traditional methods, DenoGrad preserves the original data distribution while improving the robustness of AI models, especially interpretable ones. The framework is validated on tabular and time series datasets under various noise conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising strategies. <div>
arXiv:2511.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

<div> Keywords: PDDL planning, qualitative state-trajectory constraints, compilation without grounding, large-scale planning, planning competition evaluation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses planning problems within a fragment of PDDL that includes qualitative state-trajectory constraints, which represent crucial real-world requirements such as safety, task ordering, and intermediate goals. Traditional approaches rely on compiling away these constraints to leverage existing state-of-the-art planners. However, these methods require grounding the problem first, which does not scale well for problems with many objects or high-arity actions. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose two novel compilation methods that do not require grounding, thus enabling scalability to large planning problems. They provide formal proofs of the correctness of these compilers and analyze their worst-case time complexity. An empirical evaluation using benchmark domains from the International Planning Competition demonstrates that their approaches generate planning specifications significantly more compact—by orders of magnitude—compared to grounding-based compilers. Furthermore, despite the increased succinctness, their compiled specifications remain competitive in planning performance when used with advanced planners. Overall, the work contributes scalable, formally backed compilation techniques that facilitate efficient planning in complex, constraint-rich domains without the bottleneck of grounding. <div>
arXiv:2511.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

<title>Advanced Black-Box Tuning of Large Language Models with Limited API Calls</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: black-box tuning, large language models, Gaussian Process surrogate, API call reduction, proxy model training<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of adapting large language models (LLMs) when direct access to model parameters is not possible, focusing on black-box tuning methods. Existing approaches either rely on training a small proxy model separately, which is efficient but offers limited improvements, or require frequent API calls to the foundation model, resulting in high computational costs. To overcome this dilemma, the authors propose an advanced black-box tuning approach that drastically reduces the number of API calls while maintaining or improving accuracy. The core innovation is the use of a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model trained on "LogitMap Pairs," which are obtained from minimal yet highly informative queries to the foundation model. This surrogate approximates the foundation model’s behavior, enabling proxy model training with fewer direct API queries. Experimental results demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement from 55.92% to 86.85%, while reducing API query frequency to just 1.38%. This method outperforms fully offline approaches with no API access and rivals query-intensive methods in accuracy, offering a cost-effective and efficient paradigm for language model adaptation in black-box scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2511.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

<div> Keywords: multimodal learning, traffic signal modeling, frequency domain, contrastive learning, urban mobility<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses challenges in modeling urban traffic signals, highlighting limitations of existing unimodal approaches that rely solely on numerical sensor data and neglect semantic information from heterogeneous urban data. <br />2. To overcome this, the authors propose MTP (Multimodal Traffic Profiling), a novel multimodal framework integrating numeric, visual, and textual data sources to capture comprehensive traffic signal features.<br />3. The framework conducts visual augmentation by converting traffic signals into frequency and periodicity images for enhanced visual feature extraction.<br />4. Textual augmentation is performed using descriptive texts enriched with topic, background, and item-specific information for improved textual representation.<br />5. Numeric data is processed through frequency multilayer perceptrons to extract refined frequency-domain features.<br />6. A hierarchical contrastive learning approach is designed to effectively fuse multimodal information across the three data branches.<br />7. Experimental validation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that MTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in modeling and predicting complex traffic dynamics, supporting safer travel and optimized urban mobility. <div>
arXiv:2511.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

<div> Keywords: Neural Combinatorial Optimization, Vehicle Routing Problem, Instance Synthesis, Large Language Models, Generalization

<br /><br />Summary: Recent developments in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have enhanced neural solvers' performance on synthetic routing problems but face challenges generalizing to real-world Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) instances. This paper introduces Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), an approach that leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic VRP instances with structural characteristics resembling real-world benchmarks. EvoReal works by creating synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mirror those of authentic real data, thereby enriching the training distribution. NCO models are then progressively refined: first by aligning them with this newly synthesized, structurally realistic data, and subsequently via direct fine-tuning on established benchmark datasets including TSPLib and CVRPLib. Through extensive experiments, EvoReal significantly improves the generalization ability of leading neural solvers, reducing the performance gap relative to optimal solutions to 1.05% on TSPLib and 2.71% on CVRPLib. This approach effectively bridges the gap between training on synthetic uniform data and testing on real-world VRP instances across diverse problem scales, marking a substantial step forward in applying NCO methods to practical routing problems. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, knowledge graphs, multi-hop question answering, uncertainty-aware pruning, reasoning paths<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning, particularly hallucinations and transparency issues, by integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance performance on complex knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing KG-enhanced LLM methods suffer from inaccurate retrieval, reasoning failures, and challenges caused by long input contexts and inadequate context constructions for different question types. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into manageable sub-questions. ProgRAG progressively extends partial reasoning paths by sequentially answering these sub-questions, thereby structuring the reasoning process. At each step, external retrievers collect candidate evidence, which is then refined using uncertainty-aware pruning powered by the LLM, reducing noise and improving relevance. The final reasoning context for the LLM is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths derived from answers to sub-questions, enhancing logical clarity and reasoning quality. Experimental results across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms current approaches in multi-hop KGQA tasks, offering improved reliability, accuracy, and reasoning quality in complex question answering scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

<div> Peptide classification, protein language models, graph attention network, contrastive training, interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper presents PepTriX, a novel framework designed for peptide classification tasks such as toxicity prediction and HIV inhibition, which are critical in bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted 1D peptide sequence encodings, limiting generalization across datasets and tasks. While recent protein language models like ESM-2 and ESMFold deliver strong performance, they suffer from costly fine-tuning and complex latent representations that reduce interpretability for domain experts. PepTriX addresses these challenges by integrating 1D sequence embeddings with 3D structural features using a graph attention network enhanced by contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention mechanisms. This approach allows automatic adaptation to diverse datasets, generating task-specific peptide vectors that maintain biological relevance. Evaluation by domain experts reveals that PepTriX not only achieves robust, accurate predictions across multiple peptide classification tasks but also offers interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs influencing the results. Consequently, PepTriX bridges the gap between high-performance peptide-level models and biologically meaningful, interpretable representations, fostering improved understanding and validation in peptide research. <div>

Abstract: Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

<title>Beyond Single-Step Updates: Reinforcement Learning of Heuristics with Limited-Horizon Search</title>

<div> Keywords: heuristic search, sequential decision-making, reinforcement learning, approximate value iteration, shortest-path problem<br /><br />Summary:  
Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the goal is to find the minimum cost path from a start state to a goal state. Heuristic search methods are commonly used in solving these problems by estimating the cost to reach the goal from any given state through a heuristic function. Recent advances use reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep approximate value iteration, to learn these heuristics automatically. Traditional methods typically perform single-step Bellman updates, updating the heuristic value of a state based only on its best immediate neighbor and edge cost. This paper proposes a generalized framework that improves both the sampling of states and the update of heuristics by conducting limited-horizon searches. Instead of only considering immediate neighbors, the heuristic of each state is updated based on the shortest path cost to the search frontier, which integrates both edge costs along the path and heuristic values of the frontier states. This approach potentially leads to more informed heuristic updates, improving the quality and efficiency of heuristic search in sequential decision-making tasks. <div>

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

<div> Dynamic Bayesian networks, Conditional independence, Temporal logic, Verification complexity, Structural properties<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) model probabilistic systems with evolving interdependent random variables. This paper focuses on verifying the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions within DBNs using temporal logic specifications. Two specification formalisms are considered: linear temporal logic (LTL) and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). Verification has two variants: stochastic CI properties, which account for specific probability distributions, and structural CI properties, which depend purely on the graphical structure of the DBN. The authors prove that deciding if a stochastic CI property eventually holds is at least as difficult as the Skolem problem, a well-known open problem in number theory. For structural CI properties, verification against LTL and NBA specifications lies within PSPACE complexity, but is NP- and coNP-hard. Additionally, the paper identifies certain natural restrictions on DBN graphical structures that make the verification of structural CI properties computationally feasible. Overall, this work advances understanding of the computational boundaries involved in verifying probabilistic independence relations evolving over time in DBNs. <div>

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are compact graphical representations used to model probabilistic systems where interdependent random variables and their distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic B\"uchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

<div> Keywords: Large Vision-Language Models, object hallucination, spurious correlations, Structural Causal Model, Causal-HalBench<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the problem of object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models mistakenly detect objects in images that are not present.  
1. The root cause is identified as spurious correlations, especially due to frequent co-occurrences of certain objects during training, causing models to be biased by visual context rather than actual content.  
2. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on detecting hallucinations but do not formally characterize or quantitatively evaluate the role of spurious correlations in LVLMs.  
3. To fill this gap, the authors introduce a causal analysis framework by developing a Structural Causal Model (SCM) tailored to the object recognition scenario in LVLMs, which allows formal definition of spurious correlations via causality concepts.  
4. They propose Causal-HalBench, a new benchmark containing counterfactual samples alongside comprehensive causal metrics, designed to rigorously measure the robustness of LVLMs against spurious co-occurrence bias.  
5. Additionally, an extensible pipeline for generating these counterfactual samples is introduced, exploiting proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models to create realistic and controlled data variations.  
6. Experimental results on popular LVLMs using the Causal-HalBench demonstrate that while all tested models are vulnerable to spurious correlations, the extent of their susceptibility varies, highlighting a need for improved model design and evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

<div> bidirectional search, bounded-suboptimal, BAE*, weighted A*, heuristic algorithms<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the area of bounded-suboptimal bidirectional heuristic search, which involves finding solutions within a predefined bound on solution cost suboptimality. Unlike previous research focusing primarily on optimal bidirectional search algorithms, the authors extend the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm BAE*, originally designed for consistent heuristics, by developing several variants tailored specifically for bounded-suboptimal search. These new variants aim to balance solution quality with computational efficiency under specified suboptimality bounds. The study includes an experimental evaluation comparing the performance of the proposed BAE* variants against other existing bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search algorithms as well as the well-known weighted A* algorithm. Results indicate that no single algorithm dominates universally; instead, each method shows superior performance in different problem settings or under varying conditions. This highlights the nuanced trade-offs between search efficiency, optimality bounds, and heuristic consistency in bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search. The work contributes to both theoretical understanding and practical considerations for designing heuristic search algorithms when approximate solutions within guaranteed bounds are acceptable. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

<div> Keywords: Small Language Models, NPC dialogue system, modular memory, persona-aligned training, gaming applications  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in computer game dialogue systems due to their high hardware demands, latency issues, and difficulties in maintaining clear knowledge boundaries within game environments. To overcome these obstacles, the authors propose a modular NPC dialogue system that utilizes Small Language Models (SLMs). These SLMs are fine-tuned on synthetic, persona-aligned data to reflect specific NPC characters, ensuring personalized conversational behavior. The system integrates runtime-swappable memory modules that store character-specific conversational context and world knowledge. This design allows the NPCs to maintain expressive, consistent interactions and long-term memory capabilities during gameplay without needing to retrain models or reload them. The authors evaluate their approach using three open-source SLMs—DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct—running on consumer-grade hardware, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency. Although the primary motivation is gaming, the modular design and persona-driven memory architecture make the system adaptable for broader domains such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, and interactive educational systems, where scalable, memory-rich, and expressive conversational agents are valuable. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

<div> Keywords: Fake news detection, large language models, writing style, event-centric content, knowledge distillation

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of fake news detection, which has become less effective as adversaries mimic authentic news writing styles. To overcome this, the authors propose FactGuard, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract event-centric content, minimizing dependence on writing style. FactGuard introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that detects contradictions and ambiguous factual reasoning, adaptively integrating LLM advice to improve the reliability of fake news identification. Recognizing the practical constraints of deploying LLMs, the authors also employ knowledge distillation to create FactGuard-D, a lightweight version designed for cold-start and resource-limited environments. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FactGuard consistently outperforms existing methods, offering enhanced robustness and accuracy. The framework effectively addresses challenges related to style sensitivity and LLM usability, paving the way for more reliable and efficient fake news detection in real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

<div> Privacy leakage, abductive explanations, AI decision-making, Potentially Applicable Explanations, privacy auditing<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses privacy leakage risks inherent in AI-based decision-making systems, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred from model outputs. It introduces a formal framework for auditing privacy leakage by employing abductive explanations, which identify the minimal sufficient evidence justifying specific model decisions. The framework extends to both individual and system-level privacy leakage analyses and introduces the novel concept of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to recognize individuals whose decision outcomes can protect or “shield” those possessing sensitive features. Through this approach, the framework offers rigorous privacy guarantees while simultaneously providing human-understandable explanations crucial for auditing purposes. The authors validate their method experimentally using the German Credit Dataset, demonstrating how the involvement and importance of sensitive literals in the decision process impact privacy leakage. Despite facing computational challenges and relying on some simplifying assumptions, the results indicate that abductive reasoning is a viable tool for interpretable privacy auditing. Ultimately, the proposed framework highlights a practical avenue to balance transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preservation in AI decision-making systems. <div>

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

<div> Keywords: large language models, theorem autoformalization, abstract structures, Lean proof assistant, structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of formalizing mathematical theorems that instantiate abstract structures within concrete settings, particularly focusing on research-level mathematics. The authors propose a novel framework called structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), designed to bridge the gap between abstract theories and their concrete formalizations in the Lean proof assistant. In SITA, abstract mathematical structures are modular templates encapsulating definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems, which can be reused as guides for formalizing specific instances. Given a concrete instantiation, the framework automatically generates corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrates them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and verifies theorems by checking structural assumptions. The methodology combines large language model (LLM)-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to balance automation with formal correctness. Experimental evaluations on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate SITA’s effectiveness in formalizing a variety of instances grounded in abstract frameworks. This work contributes to automated formal verification by enabling scalable, reusable, and verified formalizations of complex mathematical results across abstract and concrete domains. <div>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

<div> Keywords: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, decentralized MARL, policy summarization, query-based explanations, user studies  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently attracted widespread attention for enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in diverse application areas. However, existing explanation approaches mainly target centralized MARL and do not sufficiently address uncertainty and nondeterministic behaviors in decentralized MARL settings. This paper introduces novel methods for generating policy summarizations that accurately capture task sequencing and cooperation among agents operating under decentralized policies. Additionally, it presents query-based explanation techniques designed to answer specific user questions categorized as When, Why Not, and What, focusing on particular agent behaviors. The proposed approach is evaluated across four distinct MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its broad applicability and computational efficiency. User studies validate that these summarizations and explanations substantially improve users’ ability to answer questions about agent behavior and significantly enhance subjective measures such as understanding, clarity, and user satisfaction. The results emphasize the importance and effectiveness of tailored explanation methods in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning contexts, facilitating better human interpretability and trust in complex agent systems. <div>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

arXiv:2511.10416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

<div> Keywords: Explainable Constraint Solving, step-wise explanation, proof conversion, conflict explanation, computational efficiency<br /><br />Summary:  
In Explainable Constraint Solving, explaining why a problem is unsatisfiable often involves providing a step-wise explanation sequence that details individual reasoning steps drawn from the original constraints. However, generating these explanations step-by-step is computationally intensive, restricting their practical use. This paper proposes leveraging proofs produced by constraint solvers as initial inputs for constructing step-wise explanations, avoiding the costly step-wise computation. The authors introduce a framework of abstract proofs capable of representing both proofs and step-wise explanation sequences uniformly. They develop several techniques to convert these proofs into concise step-wise explanation sequences, emphasizing trimming and simplification methods to reduce the size of the sequences and individual explanation steps. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach substantially accelerates the generation of step-wise explanations compared to existing methods, without sacrificing explanation quality. Overall, the work enhances the scalability and applicability of explainable unsatisfiability diagnosis in constraint solving by bridging proof representations and explanation sequences effectively. <div>
arXiv:2511.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

<div> Keywords: step-wise explanations, preference elicitation, normalization techniques, MACHOP, logic puzzles<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of producing comprehensible step-wise explanations for logic puzzles and satisfaction problems by selecting the best explanation steps from many candidates using a user-defined objective function. The difficulty lies in defining a good objective function that accurately reflects user preferences. To overcome this, the authors apply interactive preference elicitation methods from machine learning, learning user preferences through pairwise comparisons of explanation steps. They identify that explanation quality is measured by multiple sub-objectives with differing scales and propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features, stabilizing the learning process. To manage the prevalence of similar explanation comparisons, they introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that combines non-domination constraints with an upper confidence bound-based diversification approach. The efficacy of these elicitation techniques is tested on Sudoku puzzles and Logic-Grid puzzles through experiments using artificial users, and further validated in real-user studies. Results demonstrate that MACHOP consistently generates higher-quality explanations compared to standard methods, improving the interpretability and user satisfaction of step-wise explanations in combinatorial reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2511.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

<div> Standpoint logics, modal logic S4F, non-monotonic reasoning, multi-viewpoint semantics, computational complexity

<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces S4F Standpoint Logic, a novel formalism that integrates standpoint propositional logic with the modal logic S4F. The purpose of this new logic is to provide a unified framework capable of representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints while accommodating non-monotonic reasoning. The authors define the syntax and semantics of S4F Standpoint Logic, demonstrating that it generalizes both of its constituent logics. A significant contribution of the work is the computational complexity analysis, which reveals that incorporating standpoint reasoning into S4F does not increase computational hardness compared to handling either logic separately. This means that reasoning within S4F Standpoint Logic remains computationally feasible. Additionally, the paper discusses mechanisms for both credulous and sceptical acceptance, catering to different modes of reasoning and belief acceptance frameworks within the logic. The proposed framework is further illustrated through an example, showing how multi-viewpoint non-monotonic semantic commitments can be effectively expressed and reasoned about. Overall, this work advances the logical tools available for modeling complex reasoning scenarios involving multiple perspectives and non-monotonicity without sacrificing computational tractability. <div>

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

<title>Bi-Level Contextual Bandits for Individualized Resource Allocation under Delayed Feedback</title>

Abstract: Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

<title>Probability-Biased Attention over Directed Bipartite Graphs for Long-Tail ICD Coding</title>

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of molecular structures is important for the prediction of molecular ground-state conformation involving property information. Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures.

<title>VEDA: 3D Molecular Generation via Variance-Exploding Diffusion with Annealing</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Despite growing reference libraries and advanced computational tools, progress in the field of metabolomics remains constrained by low rates of annotating measured spectra. The recent developments of large language models (LLMs) have led to strong performance across a wide range of generation and reasoning tasks, spurring increased interest in LLMs' application to domain-specific scientific challenges, such as mass spectra annotation. Here, we present a novel framework, General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF), that guides pretrained LLMs through spectra simulation using structured prompting and reasoning. GIF utilizes tagging, structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, instruction-based prompts, and iterative refinement. Indeed, GIF offers a structured alternative to ad hoc prompting, underscoring the need for systematic guidance of LLMs on complex scientific tasks. Using GIF, we evaluate current generalist LLMs' ability to use reasoning towards fragmentation and to perform intensity prediction after fine-tuning. We benchmark performance on a novel QA dataset, the MassSpecGym QA-sim dataset, that we derive from the MassSpecGym dataset. Through these implementations of GIF, we find that GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve a cosine similarity of 0.36 and 0.35 between the simulated and true spectra, respectively, outperforming other pretrained models including GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and ChemDFM, despite GPT-5's recency and ChemDFM's domain specialization. GIF outperforms several deep learning baselines. Our evaluation of GIF highlights the value of using LLMs not only for spectra simulation but for enabling human-in-the-loop workflows and structured, explainable reasoning in molecular fragmentation.

Abstract: Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) limit the clinical utility of prostate cancer genomics by delaying diagnosis and therapy when evidence for pathogenicity or benignity is incomplete. Progress is further limited by inconsistent annotations across sources and the absence of a prostate-specific benchmark for fair comparison. We introduce Prostate-VarBench, a curated pipeline for creating prostate-specific benchmarks that integrates COSMIC (somatic cancer mutations), ClinVar (expert-curated clinical variants), and TCGA-PRAD (prostate tumor genomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas) into a harmonized dataset of 193,278 variants supporting patient- or gene-aware splits to prevent data leakage. To ensure data integrity, we corrected a Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) issue that merged multiple transcript records, introducing ambiguity in clinical significance fields. We then standardized 56 interpretable features across eight clinically relevant tiers, including population frequency, variant type, and clinical context. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores were incorporated to enhance missense variant classification and reduce VUS uncertainty. Building on this resource, we trained an interpretable TabNet model to classify variant pathogenicity, whose step-wise sparse masks provide per-case rationales consistent with molecular tumor board review practices. On the held-out test set, the model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced class metrics, and the VEP correction yields an 6.5% absolute reduction in VUS.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in modern cybersecurity frameworks by providing a primary defense mechanism against sophisticated threat actors. In this paper, we propose an explainable intrusion detection framework that integrates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest (RF) to enhance detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). By using CICIDS2017 dataset, the approach begins with comprehensive data preprocessing and narrows down the most significant features via RFE. A Random Forest (RF) model was trained on the refined feature set, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) used to interpret the contribution of each selected feature. Our experiment demonstrates that the explainable RF-RFE achieved a detection accuracy of 99.9%, reducing false positive and computational cost in comparison to traditional classifiers. The findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating explainable AI and feature selection to develop a robust, transparent, and deployable IDS solution.

Abstract: The growing number of medical tomography examinations has necessitated the development of automated methods capable of extracting comprehensive imaging features to facilitate downstream tasks such as tumor characterization, while assisting physicians in managing their growing workload. However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $\tau$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/\kappa)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/\delta)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $\kappa>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are optimised around high-resource assumptions about language, knowledge, devices, and connectivity. Whilst widely accessible, they often misfit conditions in the Global South. As a result, users must often perform additional work to make these systems usable. We term this alignment debt: the user-side burden that arises when AI systems fail to align with cultural, linguistic, infrastructural, or epistemic contexts. We develop and validate a four-part taxonomy of alignment debt through a survey of 411 AI users in Kenya and Nigeria. Among respondents measurable on this taxonomy (n = 385), prevalence is: Cultural and Linguistic (51.9%), Infrastructural (43.1%), Epistemic (33.8%), and Interaction (14.0%). Country comparisons show a divergence in Infrastructural and Interaction debt, challenging one-size-fits-Africa assumptions. Alignment debt is associated with compensatory labour, but responses vary by debt type: users facing Epistemic challenges verify outputs at significantly higher rates (91.5% vs. 80.8%; p = 0.037), and verification intensity correlates with cumulative debt burden (Spearmans rho = 0.147, p = 0.004). In contrast, Infrastructural and Interaction debts show weak or null associations with verification, indicating that some forms of misalignment cannot be resolved through verification alone. These findings show that fairness must be judged not only by model metrics but also by the burden imposed on users at the margins, compelling context-aware safeguards that alleviate alignment debt in Global South settings. The alignment debt framework provides an empirically grounded way to measure user burden, informing both design practice and emerging African AI governance efforts.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Abstract: Inspired by infant development, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for autonomous self-exploration in a robotic agent, Baby Sophia, using the BabyBench simulation environment. The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time. All our codes and dataset splits are available at https://github.com/filipberanek/woodscape_revision.

<title>TawPipe: Topology-Aware Weight Pipeline Parallelism for Accelerating Long-Context Large Models Training</title>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Feature Quality and Adaptability of Medical Foundation Models: A Comparative Evaluation for Radiographic Classification and Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

<title>History Rhymes: Macro-Contextual Retrieval for Robust Financial Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09754</link>

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&amp;P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.

Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.

Abstract: Resource orchestration and configuration parameter search are key concerns for container-based infrastructure in cloud data centers. Large configuration search space and cloud uncertainties are often mitigated using contextual bandit techniques for resource orchestration including the state-of-the-art Drone orchestrator. Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces variability in workloads and resource metrics, making orchestration decisions less accurate due to increased nonlinearity and noise. Ksurf, a state-of-the-art variance-minimizing estimator method ideal for highly variable cloud data, enables optimal resource estimation under conditions of high cloud variability.
  This work evaluates the performance of Ksurf on estimation-based resource orchestration tasks involving highly variable workloads when employed as a contextual multi-armed bandit objective function model for cloud scenarios using Drone. Ksurf enables significantly lower latency variance of $41\%$ at p95 and $47\%$ at p99, demonstrates a $4\%$ reduction in CPU usage and 7 MB reduction in master node memory usage on Kubernetes, resulting in a $7\%$ cost savings in average worker pod count on VarBench Kubernetes benchmark.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

<title>Constrained Best Arm Identification with Tests for Feasibility</title>

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-\delta$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($\delta\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/kdafnis/STS.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

<title>Multiple Treatments Causal Effects Estimation with Task Embeddings and Balanced Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: The simultaneous application of multiple treatments is increasingly common in many fields, such as healthcare and marketing. In such scenarios, it is important to estimate the single treatment effects and the interaction treatment effects that arise from treatment combinations. Previous studies have proposed using independent outcome networks with subnetworks for interactions, or combining task embedding networks that capture treatment similarity with variational autoencoders. However, these methods suffer from the lack of parameter sharing among related treatments, or the estimation of unnecessary latent variables reduces the accuracy of causal effect estimation. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework that incorporates a task embedding network and a representation learning network with the balancing penalty. The task embedding network enables parameter sharing across related treatment patterns because it encodes elements common to single effects and contributions specific to interaction effects. The representation learning network with the balancing penalty learns representations nonparametrically from observed covariates while reducing distances in representation distributions across different treatment patterns. This process mitigates selection bias and avoids model misspecification. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines, and application to real-world marketing datasets confirms the practical implications and utility of our framework.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

<title>Expandable and Differentiable Dual Memories with Orthogonal Regularization for Exemplar-free Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

Abstract: AI programming assistants have demonstrated a tendency to generate code containing basic security vulnerabilities. While developers are ultimately responsible for validating and reviewing such outputs, improving the inherent quality of these generated code snippets remains essential. A key contributing factor to insecure outputs is the presence of vulnerabilities in the training datasets used to build large language models (LLMs). To address this issue, we propose curating training data to include only code that is free from detectable vulnerabilities. In this study, we constructed a secure dataset by filtering an existing Python corpus using a static analysis tool to retain only vulnerability-free functions. We then trained two transformer-based models: one on the curated dataset and one on the original, unfiltered dataset. The models were evaluated on both the correctness and security of the code they generated in response to natural language function descriptions. Our results show that the model trained on the curated dataset produced outputs with fewer security issues, while maintaining comparable functional correctness. These findings highlight the importance of secure training data in improving the reliability of AI-based programming assistants, though further enhancements to model architecture and evaluation are needed to reinforce these outcomes.

<title>A General Anchor-Based Framework for Scalable Fair Clustering</title>

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

<title>Scale-Aware Relay and Scale-Adaptive Loss for Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09891</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

<title>Compensating Distribution Drifts in Class-incremental Learning of Pre-trained Vision Transformers</title>

arXiv:2511.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instrument control requires methods that go beyond standard, stateless algorithmic benchmarks, since the behavior of physical systems cannot be fully captured by unit tests alone. Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.

Abstract: We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Armanfard-Lab/MultiTab.

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.

Abstract: The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various domains, including biomedicine and healthcare, and demonstrate remarkable potential from scientific research to new drug discovery. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale. FastbmRAG is public available in https://github.com/menggf/fastbmRAG.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

<title>Temporal Latent Variable Structural Causal Model for Causal Discovery under External Interferences</title>

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

<title>Moral Change or Noise? On Problems of Aligning AI With Temporally Unstable Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.

<title>BuddyMoE: Exploiting Expert Redundancy to Accelerate Memory-Constrained Mixture-of-Experts Inference</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (O2O-RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for safe and efficient robotic policy deployment but suffers from two fundamental challenges: limited coverage of multimodal behaviors and distributional shifts during online adaptation. We propose UEPO, a unified generative framework inspired by large language model pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a multi-seed dynamics-aware diffusion policy that efficiently captures diverse modalities without training multiple models; (2) a dynamic divergence regularization mechanism that enforces physically meaningful policy diversity; and (3) a diffusion-based data augmentation module that enhances dynamics model generalization. On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

Abstract: In this paper, military use cases or applications and implementation thereof are considered for natural language processing and large language models, which have broken into fame with the invention of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and the extensive foundation model pretraining done by OpenAI for ChatGPT and others. First, we interrogate a GPT-based language model (viz. Microsoft Copilot) to make it reveal its own knowledge about their potential military applications and then critically assess the information. Second, we study how commercial cloud services (viz. Microsoft Azure) could be used readily to build such applications and assess which of them are feasible. We conclude that the summarization and generative properties of language models directly facilitate many applications at large and other features may find particular uses.

Abstract: The discovery of advanced metallic alloys is hindered by vast composition spaces, competing property objectives, and real-world constraints on manufacturability. Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method. More implementation details and extended results are available at https://github.com/sugelamyd123/Sup-for-GEA.

We curated and labeled a dataset of 225 multispectral images of two Maldivian islands, which we publicly release, and fine-tuned both the 300M and 600M parameter versions of Prithvi on training subsets ranging from 5 to 181 images. Our experiments show that even with as few as 5 training images, the models achieve high performance (F1 of 0.94, IoU of 0.79). Our results demonstrate the strong transfer learning capability of Prithvi, underscoring the potential of such models to support coastal monitoring in data-poor regions.

<title>Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $\Delta$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\'evy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench. Warning: this paper includes examples that may be offensive or harmful.

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital media necessitates robust methods for copyright protection and content authentication. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of digital image watermarking techniques implemented using the spatial domain (Least Significant Bit - LSB), the frequency domain (Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT), and a novel hybrid (LSB+DFT) approach. The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality. The proposed hybrid LSB+DFT technique, which leverages redundant embedding and a fallback extraction mechanism, is shown to provide the optimal balance, maintaining high visual fidelity while exhibiting superior resilience to all tested attacks.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

<title>H3Former: Hypergraph-based Semantic-Aware Aggregation via Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss for Fine-Grained Visual Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Abstract: In recent years, LLMs have been widely integrated into software engineering workflows, supporting tasks like code generation. However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.

Abstract: Most existing robotic manipulation benchmarks focus on simplified tabletop scenarios, typically involving a stationary robotic arm interacting with various objects on a flat surface. To address this limitation, we introduce RoboBenchMart, a more challenging and realistic benchmark designed for dark store environments, where robots must perform complex manipulation tasks with diverse grocery items. This setting presents significant challenges, including dense object clutter and varied spatial configurations -- with items positioned at different heights, depths, and in close proximity. By targeting the retail domain, our benchmark addresses a setting with strong potential for near-term automation impact. We demonstrate that current state-of-the-art generalist models struggle to solve even common retail tasks. To support further research, we release the RoboBenchMart suite, which includes a procedural store layout generator, a trajectory generation pipeline, evaluation tools and fine-tuned baseline models.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

<title>MonkeyOCR v1.5 Technical Report: Unlocking Robust Document Parsing for Complex Patterns</title>

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

<title>Enhancing Kernel Power K-means: Scalable and Robust Clustering with Random Fourier Features and Possibilistic Method</title>

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in closed-loop planning benchmarks have significantly improved the evaluation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.

<title>Improving Perturbation-based Explanations by Understanding the Role of Uncertainty Calibration</title>

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

Abstract: Protein structure determination has long been one of the primary challenges of structural biology, to which deep machine learning (ML)-based approaches have increasingly been applied. However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

<title>LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

<title>Beyond Elicitation: Provision-based Prompt Optimization for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks</title>

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

Abstract: One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.

Abstract: Olympiad-level physics problem-solving presents a significant challenge for both humans and artificial intelligence (AI), as it requires a sophisticated integration of precise calculation, abstract reasoning, and a fundamental grasp of physical principles. The Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO), renowned for its complexity and depth, serves as an ideal and rigorous testbed for these advanced capabilities. In this paper, we introduce LOCA-R (LOgical Chain Augmentation for Reasoning), an improved version of the LOCA framework adapted for complex reasoning, and apply it to the CPhO 2025 theory examination. LOCA-R achieves a near-perfect score of 313 out of 320 points, solidly surpassing the highest-scoring human competitor and significantly outperforming all baseline methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Abstract: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

Abstract: We present the results of a large-scale computational analysis of mathematical papers from the ArXiv repository, demonstrating a comprehensive system that not only detects mathematical errors but provides complete referee reports with journal tier recommendations. Our automated analysis system processed over 37,000 papers across multiple mathematical categories, revealing significant error rates and quality distributions. Remarkably, the system identified errors in papers spanning three centuries of mathematics, including works by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859), as well as contemporary Fields medalists.
  In Numerical Analysis (math.NA), we observed an error rate of 9.6\% (2,271 errors in 23,761 papers), while Geometric Topology (math.GT) showed 6.5\% (862 errors in 13,209 papers). Strikingly, Category Theory (math.CT) showed 0\% errors in 93 papers analyzed, with evidence suggesting these results are ``easier'' for automated analysis. Beyond error detection, the system evaluated papers for journal suitability, recommending 0.4\% for top generalist journals, 15.5\% for top field-specific journals, and categorizing the remainder across specialist venues. These findings demonstrate both the universality of mathematical error across all eras and the feasibility of automated comprehensive mathematical peer review at scale.
  This work demonstrates that the methodology, while applied here to mathematics, is discipline-agnostic and could be readily extended to physics, computer science, and other fields represented in the ArXiv repository.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

Abstract: The WikiRace game, where players navigate between Wikipedia articles using only hyperlinks, serves as a compelling benchmark for goal-directed search in complex information networks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of navigation strategies for this task, comparing agents guided by graph-theoretic structure (betweenness centrality), semantic meaning (language model embeddings), and hybrid approaches. Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods. Our findings highlight the critical limitations of purely structural heuristics for goal-directed search and underscore the transformative potential of large language models to act as powerful, zero-shot semantic navigators in complex information spaces.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

Abstract: Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.
  We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.

<title>Know Your Limits: Entropy Estimation Modeling for Compression and Generalization</title>

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

<title>Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

Abstract: Multi-modal conversation emotion recognition (MCER) aims to recognize and track the speaker's emotional state using text, speech, and visual information in the conversation scene. Analyzing and studying MCER issues is significant to affective computing, intelligent recommendations, and human-computer interaction fields. Unlike the traditional single-utterance multi-modal emotion recognition or single-modal conversation emotion recognition, MCER is a more challenging problem that needs to deal with more complex emotional interaction relationships. The critical issue is learning consistency and complementary semantics for multi-modal feature fusion based on emotional interaction relationships. To solve this problem, people have conducted extensive research on MCER based on deep learning technology, but there is still a lack of systematic review of the modeling methods. Therefore, a timely and comprehensive overview of MCER's recent advances in deep learning is of great significance to academia and industry. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of MCER modeling methods and roughly divide MCER methods into four categories, i.e., context-free modeling, sequential context modeling, speaker-differentiated modeling, and speaker-relationship modeling. In addition, we further discuss MCER's publicly available popular datasets, multi-modal feature extraction methods, application areas, existing challenges, and future development directions. We hope that our review can help MCER researchers understand the current research status in emotion recognition, provide some inspiration, and develop more efficient models.

<title>Enhancing Conflict Resolution in Language Models via Abstract Argumentation</title>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in developing human-like and engaging dialogue systems. However, in tasks such as consensus-building and persuasion, LLMs often struggle to resolve conflicts arising from incomplete or inconsistent information, revealing their limitations in real-world applications. Given these limitations, abstract argumentation, a specialized logical framework designed to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies, becomes particularly relevant. In this paper, we aim to enhance the conflict-solving capabilities of LLMs by leveraging formal abstract argumentation, integrating language model learning with symbolic computation. To achieve this, we develop and curate a dataset comprising diverse abstract argumentation frameworks, accompanied by detailed explanations of the argument acceptability computation process. Subsequently, we fine-tune LLMs on this dataset, focusing on abstract conflict resolution tasks. As a comparative baseline, LLMs are also evaluated using a chain-of-thought approach, however, they fail to solve the conflict-based arguments effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that process explanations play a crucial role in learning. Models trained with explanations exhibit superior generalization accuracy compared to those trained solely on question-answer pairs. Furthermore, leveraging LLMs' self-explanation capabilities, our approach provides detailed illustrations that mitigate the lack of transparency typically associated with neural networks.

Abstract: Differentiable simulators represent an environment's dynamics as a differentiable function. Within robotics and autonomous driving, this property is used in Analytic Policy Gradients (APG), which relies on backpropagating through the dynamics to train accurate policies for diverse tasks. Here we show that differentiable simulation also has an important role in world modeling, where it can impart predictive, prescriptive, and counterfactual capabilities to an agent. Specifically, we design three novel task setups in which the differentiable dynamics are combined within an end-to-end computation graph not with a policy, but a state predictor. This allows us to learn relative odometry, optimal planners, and optimal inverse states. We collectively call these predictors Analytic World Models (AWMs) and demonstrate how differentiable simulation enables their efficient, end-to-end learning. In autonomous driving scenarios, they have broad applicability and can augment an agent's decision-making beyond reactive control.

<title>Small Models Struggle to Learn from Strong Reasoners</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks, and distilling their reasoning capabilities into smaller models has shown promise. However, we uncover an interesting phenomenon, which we term the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models ($\leq$3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, we propose Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning complexity for effective reasoning capability transfer.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation, eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

Abstract: Effective tool pre-selection via retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of 1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools, enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks. We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue synthesis and tool retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average CompleteRecall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings support our hypothesis that the structural information modeled in the graph provides complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries requiring sequential tool composition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: \textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70\% accuracy to pass. PsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use: https://github.com/cloversjtu/PsychCounsel-Bench

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this, Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while it largely outperforms them on the new benchmarks. This shows that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex cryptography theorem.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.

Abstract: While extensive research has focused on ChatGPT in recent years, very few studies have systematically quantified and compared linguistic features between human-written and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated language. This study aims to investigate how various linguistic components are represented in both types of texts, assessing the ability of AI to emulate human writing. Using human-authored essays as a benchmark, we prompted ChatGPT to generate essays of equivalent length. These texts were analyzed using Open Brain AI, an online computational tool, to extract measures of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical constituents. Despite AI-generated texts appearing to mimic human speech, the results revealed significant differences across multiple linguistic features such as consonants, word stress, nouns, verbs, pronouns, direct objects, prepositional modifiers, and use of difficult words among others. These findings underscore the importance of integrating automated tools for efficient language assessment, reducing time and effort in data analysis. Moreover, they emphasize the necessity for enhanced training methodologies to improve the capacity of AI for producing more human-like text.

Abstract: This study explores text-to-SQL parsing by leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advancements, existing LLM-based methods are still inefficient and struggle to handle cases with wide tables effectively. Furthermore, current interaction-based approaches either lack a step-by-step, interpretable SQL generation process or fail to provide a universally applicable interaction design. To address these challenges, we introduce Interactive-T2S, a framework that generates SQL queries through direct interactions with databases. This framework includes four general tools that facilitate proactive and efficient information retrieval by the LLM. Additionally, we have developed detailed exemplars to demonstrate the step-wise reasoning processes within our framework. Our approach achieves advanced performance on the Spider and BIRD datasets as well as their variants. Notably, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the BIRD leaderboard under the setting without oracle knowledge, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal data to drive breakthroughs in e-commerce applications through Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) is gaining increasing attention from the research community. However, there are significant challenges that hinder the optimal use of multimodal e-commerce data by foundation models: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality multimodal benchmark datasets; and (2) the lack of effective multimodal information integration methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce MMECInstruct, the first-ever, large-scale, and high-quality multimodal instruction dataset for e-commerce. We also develop CASLIE, a simple, lightweight, yet effective framework for integrating multimodal information for e-commerce. Leveraging MMECInstruct, we fine-tune a series of e-commerce MFMs within CASLIE, denoted as CASLIE models. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that CASLIE models substantially outperform 5 categories of advanced baseline models in the in-domain evaluation. Moreover, CASLIE models show strong generalizability to out-of-domain settings. MMECInstruct and CASLIE models are publicly accessible through https://ninglab.github.io/CASLIE/.

arXiv:2410.20749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lichangh20/Matryoshka.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed in a wide variety of user-facing applications. Typically, these deployments have some specific purpose, like answering questions grounded on documentation or acting as coding assistants, but they require general language understanding. In such deployments, LLMs should respond only to queries that align with the intended purpose and reject all other requests, such as generating poetry or answering questions about physics, a task we refer to as `scoping'. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of various methods, ranging from prompting, fine-tuning to preference learning and the recently proposed general alignment technique known as Circuit Breakers (CB). Across three families of language models and a broad variety of tasks, we show that it is possible to scope language models. We examine scoping for multiple topics, and fine-grained topics. We ablate diversity of irrelevant queries, layer different techniques, conduct adversarial evaluations and more. Among other results, we find that when diverse examples of irrelevant queries are available, simple supervised fine-tuning produces the best results, but when such diversity is low, Circuit Breakers perform quite well. One can often get the benefits of both methods by layering them in succession. We intend our study to serve as a practitioner's guide to scoping LLMs.

Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is crucial for preventing suicides, a leading cause of death worldwide. Many individuals express suicidal thoughts on social media, offering a vital opportunity for early detection through advanced machine learning techniques. The identification of suicidal ideation in social media text is improved by utilising a hybrid framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), enhanced with an attention mechanism. To enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions, Explainable AI (XAI) methods are applied, with a particular focus on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), are incorporated. At first, the model managed to reach an accuracy of 92.81%. By applying fine-tuning and early stopping techniques, the accuracy improved to 94.29%. The SHAP analysis revealed key features influencing the model's predictions, such as terms related to mental health struggles. This level of transparency boosts the model's credibility while helping mental health professionals understand and trust the predictions. This work highlights the potential for improving the accuracy and interpretability of detecting suicidal tendencies, making a valuable contribution to the progress of mental health monitoring systems. It emphasizes the significance of blending powerful machine learning methods with explainability to develop reliable and impactful mental health solutions.

<title>Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors</title>

arXiv:2501.14250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) MiniMax-driven training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback, (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their robustness against adversarial misuse is crucial. This paper introduces the GAP (Graph of Attacks with Pruning) framework, an advanced approach for generating stealthy jailbreak prompts to evaluate and enhance LLM safeguards. GAP addresses limitations in existing tree-based LLM jailbreak methods by implementing an interconnected graph structure that enables knowledge sharing across attack paths. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates GAP's superiority over existing techniques, achieving a 20.8% increase in attack success rates while reducing query costs by 62.7%. GAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for attacking both open and closed LLMs, with attack success rates of >96%. Additionally, we present specialized variants like GAP-Auto for automated seed generation and GAP-VLM for multimodal attacks. GAP-generated prompts prove highly effective in improving content moderation systems, increasing true positive detection rates by 108.5% and accuracy by 183.6% when used for fine-tuning. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/dsbuddy/GAP-LLM-Safety.

arXiv:2502.02390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employ a 'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. We validate CoAT's effectiveness across a variety of generative and reasoning tasks. Quantitative experiments show that CoAT achieves over 10% performance improvement on open-source multi-hop reasoning datasets (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and more than 15% gain on our proprietary CRB dataset.

<title>Enhanced Structured Lasso Pruning with Class-wise Information</title>

arXiv:2502.09125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern applications require lightweight neural network models. Most existing neural network pruning methods focus on removing unimportant filters; however, these may result in the loss of statistical information after pruning due to failing to consider the class-wise information. In this paper, we employ the structured lasso from the perspective of utilizing precise class-wise information for model pruning with the help of Information Bottleneck theory, which guides us to ensure the retention of statistical information before and after pruning. With these techniques, we propose two novel adaptive network pruning schemes in parallel: sparse graph-structured lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (sGLP-IB) and sparse tree-guided lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (sTLP-IB). The key component is that we prune the model filters utilizing sGLP-IB and sTLP-IB with more precise structured class-wise relatedness. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods, our approaches achieve the best performance across three datasets and six model structures on extensive experiments. For example, with the VGG16 model based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we can reduce the parameters by 85%, decrease the FLOPs by 61%, and maintain an accuracy of 94.10% (0.14% better than the original). For large-scale ImageNet, we can reduce the parameters by 55% while keeping the accuracy at 76.12% (only drop 0.03%) using the ResNet architecture. In summary, we succeed in reducing the model size and computational resource usage while maintaining the effectiveness of accuracy.

arXiv:2502.13595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings are typically evaluated on a limited set of tasks, which are constrained by language, domain, and task diversity. To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale, community-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of challenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we develop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a representative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain language subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available model is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To facilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse selection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that drastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced zero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale version but at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks, yet they often fall short in ensuring the factual accuracy of their outputs, thus limiting their reliability in real-world applications where correctness is critical. In this paper, we present FactReasoner, a novel neuro-symbolic based factuality assessment framework that employs probabilistic reasoning to evaluate the truthfulness of long-form generated responses. FactReasoner decomposes a response into atomic units, retrieves relevant contextual information from external knowledge sources, and models the logical relationships (e.g., entailment, contradiction) between these units and their contexts using probabilistic encodings. It then estimates the posterior probability that each atomic unit is supported by the retrieved evidence. Our experiments on both labeled and unlabeled benchmark datasets demonstrate that FactReasoner often outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-based methods in terms of factual precision and recall. Our open-source implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/IBM/FactReasoner.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) being a critical tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism and other thoracic conditions. However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal learning strategies for improving radiology reporting. The source code is available at https://github.com/zzs95/abn-blip.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) requires high-fidelity, real-time visual feedback of dynamic and low-texture surgical scenes. To address these requirements, we introduce FeatureEndo-4DGS (FE-4DGS), the first real time pipeline leveraging feature-distilled 4D Gaussian Splatting for simultaneous reconstruction and semantic segmentation of deformable surgical environments. Unlike prior feature-distilled methods restricted to static scenes, and existing 4D approaches that lack semantic integration, FE-4DGS seamlessly leverages pre-trained 2D semantic embeddings to produce a unified 4D representation-where semantics also deform with tissue motion. This unified approach enables the generation of real-time RGB and semantic outputs through a single, parallelized rasterization process. Despite the additional complexity from feature distillation, FE-4DGS sustains real-time rendering (61 FPS) with a compact footprint, achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on EndoNeRF (39.1 PSNR) and SCARED (27.3 PSNR), and delivers competitive EndoVis18 segmentation, matching or exceeding strong 2D baselines for binary segmentation tasks (0.93 DSC) and remaining competitive for multi-label segmentation (0.77 DSC).

Abstract: Transformers, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance in large-scale image classification. However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation scheme that addresses these challenges and explicitly includes inductive biases, which commonly are part of the neural network architecture, into the training data. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds, enabling fine-grained control over image composition during training. It thus increases the data diversity and effective number of training samples. We demonstrate that training on ForNet, the application of ForAug to ImageNet, significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet and 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug enables novel ways of analyzing model behavior and quantifying biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that training on ForNet substantially reduces these biases compared to training on ImageNet. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/tobna/ForAug.

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can enhance task automation and accessibility in education. However, hallucination where LLMs generate inaccurate or misleading information remains a challenge. This study introduces the Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) mechanism, which dynamically retrieves course content from Canvas LMS and structures it within an LLM's context window via prompt engineering, enabling the LLM-powered assistant, Ask ME, to deliver context-aware, curriculum-aligned responses while mitigating hallucinations. A mixed-methods pilot study grounded in Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence) and the Technology Acceptance Model (perceived usefulness, ease of use) evaluated DCCI's effectiveness with 120 first-year programming students at E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University. The course focused on foundational programming patterns in C#, including writing program specifications. We analyzed 14,746 logged interactions and a post-course survey completed by 101 students. User satisfaction was measured via a 5-point Likert scale (turn-level ratings), while the survey assessed usability, engagement, and ethical concerns. Results indicated high satisfaction (mean 4.65/5) and strong recognition of Ask ME's ability to provide timely, contextually relevant answers to administrative and course-related queries. 78.06% agreed that Ask ME's Canvas integration reduced platform switching, improving usability, engagement, comprehension, and topic exploration. Many students reported reduced hesitation to ask questions and increased motivation for self-directed learning, though concerns about over-reliance on AI and reduced student-teacher interaction emerged. This study demonstrates that DCCI enhances LLM reliability, student satisfaction, and engagement in AI-driven educational automation, while highlighting the importance of balancing

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning aims to quickly identify solutions for new tasks with minimal or no additional interaction with the environment. Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) addresses this by combining a set of base policies to produce a new one that is at least as good -- though not necessarily optimal -- as any individual base policy. Optimality can be ensured, particularly in the linear-reward case, via techniques that compute a Convex Coverage Set (CCS). However, these are computationally expensive and do not scale to complex domains. The Option Keyboard (OK) improves upon GPI by producing policies that are at least as good -- and often better. It achieves this through a learned meta-policy that dynamically combines base policies. However, its performance critically depends on the choice of base policies. This raises a key question: is there an optimal set of base policies -- an optimal behavior basis -- that enables zero-shot identification of optimal solutions for any linear tasks? We solve this open problem by introducing a novel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis. We show that it significantly reduces the number of base policies needed to ensure optimality in new tasks. We also prove that it is strictly more expressive than a CCS, enabling particular classes of non-linear tasks to be solved optimally. We empirically evaluate our technique in challenging domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, increasingly so as task complexity increases.

Abstract: With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.

Abstract: Efficient quantum state preparation remains a central challenge in first-principles quantum simulations of dynamics in quantum field theories, where the Hilbert space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional. Here, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-assisted framework for quantum-circuit design that systematically scales state-preparation circuits to large lattice volumes. Applied to a 1+1d XY spin chain, the LLM autonomously discovers a compact 4-parameter circuit that captures boundary-induced symmetry breaking with sub-percent energy deviation, enabling successful validation on the \texttt{Zuchongzhi} quantum processor. Guided by this insight, we extend the framework to 2+1d quantum field theories, where scalable variational ans\"atze have remained elusive. For a scalar field theory, the search yields a symmetry-preserving, 3-parameter shallow-depth ansatz whose optimized parameters converge to size-independent constants for lattices $n \ge 4$, providing, to our knowledge, the first scalable ansatz for this class of 2+1d models. Our results establish a practical route toward AI-assisted, human-guided discovery in quantum simulation.

Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +3.78 pp top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding in recent years. Yet, they still lag behind human capabilities in specific visual tasks such as counting or relational reasoning. To understand the underlying limitations, we adopt methodologies from cognitive science, analyzing VLM performance along core cognitive axes: Perception, Attention, and Memory. Using a suite of tasks targeting these abilities, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o. Our analysis reveals distinct cognitive profiles: while advanced models approach ceiling performance on some tasks (e.g. category identification), a significant gap persists, particularly in tasks requiring spatial understanding or selective attention. Investigating the source of these failures and potential methods for improvement, we employ a vision-text decoupling analysis, finding that models struggling with direct visual reasoning show marked improvement when reasoning over their own generated text captions. These experiments reveal a strong need for improved VLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) abilities, even in models that consistently exceed human performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of targeted fine-tuning on composite visual reasoning tasks and show that fine-tuning smaller VLMs substantially improves core cognitive abilities. While this improvement does not translate to large enhancements on challenging, out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show broadly that VLM performance on our datasets strongly correlates with performance on these other benchmarks. Our work provides a detailed analysis of VLM cognitive strengths and weaknesses and identifies key bottlenecks in simultaneous perception and reasoning while also providing an effective and simple solution.

Abstract: LLM-based prompt optimization, that uses LLM-provided "textual gradients" (feedback) to refine prompts, has emerged an effective method for automatic prompt engineering. However, its scalability and stability are unclear when using more data in training. We systematically investigate the potential and challenges of scaling training data in textual gradient descent. We show that naively scaling training examples is infeasible due to both explicit context-length limits and an implicit context wall, where long-context degradation yields diminishing returns. Inspired by prior wisdom in stochastic gradient descent, we propose Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M), which reweights updates through momentum sampling, using bootstrapped minibatch validation accuracy as importance weights over historical prompts. We introduce Gumbel-Top-$k$ sampling for prompt generation, balancing exploration--exploitation and improving sampling efficiency while maintaining a low-variance running mean estimator. TSGD-M integrates seamlessly into existing prompt optimization frameworks, including TextGrad, DSPy-COPRO, and AdalFlow, and achieves consistent gains across 5 benchmarks. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating probabilistic exploration into textual-gradient-based optimization, paving the way for more stable and scalable prompt optimization.

<title>Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.

Abstract: As AI chatbots become integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity over whether students develop trust in them in ways similar to trusting a human peer or instructor (human-like trust, often linked to interpersonal trust models) or in ways similar to trusting a conventional technology (system-like trust, often linked to technology trust models). This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social systems, leaving their applicability to conversational, human-like agents unclear. To address this gap, we examine how these two forms of trust, human-like and system-like, comparatively influence students' perceptions of an AI chatbot, specifically perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that both forms of trust significantly influenced student perceptions, though with varied effects. Human-like trust was the stronger predictor of trusting intention, whereas system-like trust more strongly influenced behavioral intention and perceived usefulness; both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. The results suggest that interactions with AI chatbots give rise to a distinct form of trust, human-AI trust, that differs from human-human and human-technology models, highlighting the need for new theoretical frameworks in this domain. In addition, the study offers practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby protect data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable functional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable functional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof. Furthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving federated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection, robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on non-colluding dual-server settings or trusted third parties required by existing methods.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time, highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands. This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

<title>Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease</title>

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

Abstract: Which factors determine AI propensity for military intervention? While the use of AI in war games and military planning is growing exponentially, the simple analysis of key drivers embedded in the models has not yet been done. This paper does a simple conjoint experiment proposing a model to decide on military intervention in 640 vignettes where each was run for 100 times allowing to explore AI decision on military intervention systematically. The analysis finds that largest predictors of AI decision to intervene are high domestic support and high probability of success. Costs such as international condemnation, military deaths, civilian deaths, and negative economic effect are statistically significant, but their effect is around half of domestic support and probability of victory. Closing window of opportunity only reaches statistical significance in interaction with other factors. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across different models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) suggesting a pattern in AI decision-making.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks, where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks, stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger model sizes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant flexibility and robust performance. This makes them ideal for building not only system models but also advanced neural network controllers (NNCs). However, their high complexity and computational needs often limit their use. Various model compression strategies have been developed over the past few decades to address these issues. These strategies are effective for general DNNs but do not directly apply to NNCs. NNCs need both size reduction and the retention of key application-specific performance features. In structured pruning, which removes groups of related elements, standard importance metrics often fail to protect these critical characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for calculating importance metrics in pruning groups. This framework not only shrinks the model size but also considers various application-specific constraints. To find the best pruning coefficient for each group, we evaluate two approaches. The first approach involves simple exploration through grid search. The second utilizes gradient descent optimization, aiming to balance compression and task performance. We test our method in two use cases: one on an MNIST autoencoder and the other on a Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TDMPC) agent. Results show that the method effectively maintains application-relevant performance while achieving a significant reduction in model size.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), transforming these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: using only 1,272 unlabeled data, GUI-RCPO achieves 3-6% accuracy improvements across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviors or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviors that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question: do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images. EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8 essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content. Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks. Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through https://github.com/ninglab/EcomMMMU.

Abstract: Communication locality plays a key role in the performance of collective operations on large HPC systems, especially on oversubscribed networks where groups of nodes are fully connected internally but sparsely linked through global connections. We present Bine (binomial negabinary) trees, a family of collective algorithms that improve communication locality. Bine trees maintain the generality of binomial trees and butterflies while cutting global-link traffic by up to 33%. We implement eight Bine-based collectives and evaluate them on four large-scale supercomputers with Dragonfly, Dragonfly+, oversubscribed fat-tree, and torus topologies, achieving up to 5x speedups and consistent reductions in global-link traffic across different vector sizes and node counts.

arXiv:2509.04449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

<title>Dual-Mode Deep Anomaly Detection for Medical Manufacturing: Structural Similarity and Feature Distance</title>

Abstract: Automated visual inspection in medical-device manufacturing faces unique challenges, including extremely low defect rates, limited annotated data, hardware restrictions on production lines, and the need for validated, explainable artificial-intelligence systems. This paper presents two attention-guided autoencoder architectures that address these constraints through complementary anomaly-detection strategies. The first employs a multi-scale structural-similarity (4-MS-SSIM) index for inline inspection, enabling interpretable, real-time defect detection on constrained hardware. The second applies a Mahalanobis-distance analysis of randomly reduced latent features for efficient feature-space monitoring and lifecycle verification. Both approaches share a lightweight backbone optimised for high-resolution imagery for typical manufacturing conditions. Evaluations on the Surface Seal Image (SSI) dataset-representing sterile-barrier packaging inspection-demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform reference baselines, including MOCCA, CPCAE, and RAG-PaDiM, under realistic industrial constraints. Cross-domain validation on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark confirms comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art anomaly-detection methods. The dual-mode framework integrates inline anomaly detection and supervisory monitoring, advancing explainable AI architectures toward greater reliability, observability, and lifecycle monitoring in safety-critical manufacturing environments. To facilitate reproducibility, the source code developed for the experiments has been released in the project repository, while the datasets were obtained from publicly available sources.

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge, the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG. Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

<title>Collapse of Irrelevant Representations (CIR) Ensures Robust and Non-Disruptive LLM Unlearning</title>

arXiv:2509.11816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current unlearning and safety training methods consistently fail to remove dangerous knowledge from language models. We identify the root cause - unlearning targets representations which are too general - and develop a highly selective technique that unlearns robustly while preserving general performance.
  Our method performs PCA on activations and module-output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, then collapses these subspaces before computing unlearning updates, a technique we term Collapse of Irrelevant Representations (CIR). This avoids unlearning general knowledge and targets only representations specific to the facts being unlearned.
  When unlearning bio- and cyber-hazardous facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we achieve over 30x greater reduction in post-attack accuracy than the best baseline (Circuit Breakers), while disrupting general performance 30x less, and using less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.
  Thus, by disentangling harmful and benign capabilities at the level of representations, CIR enables robust and non-disruptive unlearning.

<title>Inference Offloading for Cost-Sensitive Binary Classification at the Edge</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15674</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference. Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between classification accuracy and the offloading costs within such a hierarchical inference (HI) system. To optimise this system, we propose an online learning framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and learns during the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to mismatched classifiers.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

arXiv:2509.19319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies (direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns (single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs. code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite (https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

This enables efficient, parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive, unstructured corpora, making it unclear which social patterns and biases they absorb and later reproduce. Existing evaluations typically examine outputs or activations, but rarely connect them back to the pre-training data. We introduce a pipeline that couples LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to trace how different themes are encoded during training. As a controlled case study, we trained a GPT-style model on 37 nineteenth-century novels by ten female authors, a corpus centered on themes such as gender, marriage, class, and morality. By applying SAEs across layers and probing with eleven social and moral categories, we mapped sparse features to human-interpretable concepts. The analysis revealed stable thematic backbones (most prominently around gender and kinship) and showed how associations expand and entangle with depth. More broadly, we argue that the LLM+SAEs pipeline offers a scalable framework for auditing how cultural assumptions from the data are embedded in model representations.

Abstract: Wasserstein barycenters provide a powerful tool for aggregating probability measures, while leveraging the geometry of their ambient space. Existing discrete methods suffer from poor scalability, as they require access to the complete set of samples from input measures. We address this issue by recasting the original barycenter problem as a gradient flow in the Wasserstein space. Our approach offers two advantages. First, we achieve scalability by sampling mini-batches from the input measures. Second, we incorporate functionals over probability measures, which regularize the barycenter problem through internal, potential, and interaction energies. We present two algorithms for empirical and Gaussian mixture measures, providing convergence guarantees under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. Experimental validation on toy datasets and domain adaptation benchmarks show that our methods outperform previous discrete and neural net-based methods for computing Wasserstein barycenters.

Abstract: We investigate whether contemporary multimodal LLMs can assist with grading open-ended calculus at scale without eroding validity. In a large first-year exam, students' handwritten work was graded by GPT-5 against the same rubric used by teaching assistants (TAs), with fractional credit permitted; TA rubric decisions served as ground truth. We calibrated a human-in-the-loop filter that combines a partial-credit threshold with an Item Response Theory (2PL) risk measure based on the deviation between the AI score and the model-expected score for each student-item. Unfiltered AI-TA agreement was moderate, adequate for low-stakes feedback but not for high-stakes use. Confidence filtering made the workload-quality trade-off explicit: under stricter settings, AI delivered human-level accuracy, but also left roughly 70% of the items to be graded by humans. Psychometric patterns were constrained by low stakes on the open-ended portion, a small set of rubric checkpoints, and occasional misalignment between designated answer regions and where work appeared. Practical adjustments such as slightly higher weight and protected time, a few rubric-visible substeps, stronger spatial anchoring should raise ceiling performance. Overall, calibrated confidence and conservative routing enable AI to reliably handle a sizable subset of routine cases while reserving expert judgment for ambiguous or pedagogically rich responses.

arXiv:2510.06557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

<title>A Critical Review of the Need for Knowledge-Centric Evaluation of Quranic Recitation</title>

Abstract: The art and science of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), a discipline governed by meticulous phonetic, rhythmic, and theological principles, confronts substantial educational challenges in today's digital age. Although modern technology offers unparalleled opportunities for learning, existing automated systems for evaluating recitation have struggled to gain broad acceptance or demonstrate educational effectiveness. This literature review examines this crucial disparity, offering a thorough analysis of scholarly research, digital platforms, and commercial tools developed over the past twenty years. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental flaw in current approaches that adapt Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which emphasize word identification over qualitative acoustic evaluation. These systems suffer from limitations such as reliance on biased datasets, demographic disparities, and an inability to deliver meaningful feedback for improvement. Challenging these data-centric methodologies, we advocate for a paradigm shift toward a knowledge-based computational framework. By leveraging the unchanging nature of the Quranic text and the well-defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that an effective evaluation system should be built upon rule-based acoustic modeling centered on canonical pronunciation principles and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than depending on statistical patterns derived from flawed or biased data. The review concludes that the future of automated Quranic recitation assessment lies in hybrid systems that combine linguistic expertise with advanced audio processing. Such an approach paves the way for developing reliable, fair, and pedagogically effective tools that can authentically assist learners across the globe.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.

Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.

<title>Search Is Not Retrieval: Decoupling Semantic Matching from Contextual Assembly in RAG</title>

Abstract: Retrieval systems are essential to contemporary AI pipelines, although most confuse two separate processes: finding relevant information and giving enough context for reasoning. We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR) framework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained search representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the composability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by directly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger, contextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing costs. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one, making the system architecture more like how people process information. We discuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure, implementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical foundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval.

Summary:<br /> 
This work introduces ComoRAG, a novel approach for narrative comprehension in long stories and novels. Traditional retrieval-based methods often struggle with capturing complex, interconnected relations within extended context. ComoRAG addresses this by incorporating iterative reasoning cycles and a dynamic memory workspace, mimicking the human brain's process of reasoning with memory-related signals. By generating probing queries and integrating retrieved evidence into a global memory pool, ComoRAG improves query resolution and context comprehension. It outperforms strong baseline methods across challenging narrative benchmarks, showing consistent gains up to 11%. The framework is particularly effective for complex queries requiring global context understanding, offering a principled and cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based stateful reasoning. ComoRAG is publicly available for further research and experimentation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and its high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods could fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition on reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global context comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm towards retrieval-based stateful reasoning. Our framework is made publicly available at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG.

<div> Keywords: instruction hierarchy, large language models, reasoning, reinforcement learning, safety robustness  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of enforcing instruction hierarchy (IH) in large language models (LLMs), where instructions from multiple sources (e.g., developers, users, system policies) may conflict, and higher-priority commands must override lower-priority ones. The authors reframe the problem of IH resolution as a reasoning task, requiring the model to explicitly consider the relationship between user prompts and higher-level system instructions before responding. To train this capability, they create VerIH, a dataset containing tasks that test the model’s ability to follow constraints under both aligned and conflicting instructions, with verifiable answers. Using lightweight reinforcement learning on VerIH, they demonstrate effective transfer of general reasoning to instruction prioritization. Fine-tuned models show improved performance on benchmarks related to instruction following and hierarchy enforcement. Importantly, the developed reasoning ability generalizes to out-of-distribution, safety-critical scenarios, helping the model resist adversarial inputs such as jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. The work highlights how reasoning about instruction hierarchies facilitates building more controllable, reliable, and robust LLMs, where updates to system prompts lead to predictable and safe changes in behavior. This approach offers a practical solution for deploying LLMs in high-stakes, real-world decision-making contexts requiring strict adherence to prioritized instructions. <div>

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generative models, harmful content, negative prompts, concept inversion, defense effectiveness

Summary:
Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about the potential generation of harmful content. Two main approaches have emerged to address this issue: fine-tuning models to unlearn harmful concepts and training-free guidance methods leveraging negative prompts. However, combining these approaches often leads to marginal or degraded defense performance, indicating an incompatibility between the paradigms. In response, a method is proposed that replaces negative prompts with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. This method requires no modifications to existing approaches and can easily integrate into current pipelines. Experimental validation on benchmarks for nudity and violence shows consistent improvement in defense success rates while maintaining the core semantics of input prompts. This simple yet robust method offers a promising solution to addressing harmful content generation in text-to-image generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1) fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of input prompts.

Abstract: We present MERaLiON-SER, a robust speech emotion recognition model designed for English and Southeast Asian languages. The model is trained using a hybrid objective combining weighted categorical cross-entropy and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) losses for joint discrete and dimensional emotion modelling. This dual approach enables the model to capture both the distinct categories of emotion (like happy or angry) and the fine-grained, such as arousal (intensity), valence (positivity/negativity), and dominance (sense of control), leading to a more comprehensive and robust representation of human affect. Extensive evaluations across multilingual Singaporean languages (English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil ) and other public benchmarks show that MERaLiON-SER consistently surpasses both open-source speech encoders and large Audio-LLMs. These results underscore the importance of specialised speech-only models for accurate paralinguistic understanding and cross-lingual generalisation. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a foundation for integrating emotion-aware perception into future agentic audio systems, enabling more empathetic and contextually adaptive multimodal reasoning.

<title>Too Good to be Bad: On the Failure of LLMs to Role-Play Villains</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, moral role-playing, safety alignment, villain characterization, benchmark evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article investigates the challenge large language models (LLMs) face in authentically simulating non-prosocial, antagonistic characters, focusing specifically on morally ambiguous or villainous personas. The authors hypothesize that current safety alignment protocols in LLMs create an inherent conflict with accurately portraying such morally negative roles. To explore this, they introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, which includes a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set designed for rigorous assessment of role-playing fidelity across a spectrum from moral paragons to pure villains. Using this benchmark, the study evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs and reveals a clear monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. The models exhibit the greatest difficulty with traits that directly oppose safety principles, such as deceitfulness and manipulativeness, often replacing subtle malevolence with more obvious aggression. Additionally, the research finds that general chatbot proficiency is not a reliable indicator of a model’s ability to role-play villainous characters, with models exhibiting strong safety alignment showing particularly poor performance in this area. Ultimately, the paper highlights a fundamental tension between ensuring model safety and maintaining creative fidelity in character simulation, and it proposes the benchmark and findings as a foundation for developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Summary:
The article proposes a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to improve the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional training of PINNs on complex problems faces challenges in accuracy and efficiency. The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions of rapid variation in the solution, while the adaptive weighting component balances convergence rates across the training points. Numerical experiments show that using only adaptive sampling or weighting alone is ineffective in achieving accurate predictions, especially with limited training points. The effectiveness of each method varies depending on the problem. However, by combining both strategies, the proposed approach consistently enhances prediction accuracy and training efficiency, providing a more robust solution for solving PDEs with PINNs. <div>

Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.

Summary:<br /> 
This paper introduces a novel approach to translating unconstrained English into Answer Set Programming (ASP) programs for logic puzzles. By utilizing a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs, the system generates ASP rules, facts, and constraints to fully represent and solve complex combinatorial problems. Unlike other methods that heavily rely on LLM, this system minimizes its role to simpler tasks such as simplifying language and identifying keywords, while using AMR graphs to systematically generate ASP constraints. The proposed system successfully creates an entire ASP program that effectively solves logic puzzles. This lighter-weight and more explainable approach marks a significant step towards converting natural language into solutions for intricate logic problems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

<div> Keywords: ARC-AGI, Vector Symbolic Algebras, few-shot learning, neurosymbolic methods, cognitive plausibility<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces a novel solver for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), which is a challenging few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark that remains difficult for advanced AI despite being easy for humans. The proposed solver is cognitively plausible, inspired by human intelligence frameworks that integrate System 1 intuitions (fast, automatic thinking) with System 2 reasoning (slow, deliberate thinking) using neurosymbolic techniques based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). The solver employs object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide the solution search efficiently, and facilitate sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary evaluations show the solver achieved 10.8% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval, which, while still low, indicates promising progress on this difficult benchmark. Additionally, the solver performed strongly on simpler related benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC, notably outperforming GPT-4 on the latter task with far less computational cost. This work is significant in that it is the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI, creating the most cognitively faithful ARC-AGI solver to date. The authors have made their code openly available for the research community. <div>

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks, Inference Accuracy, Policy Learning, Interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper challenges the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) objective that focuses solely on maximizing reward by proposing a novel perspective where RL systems are designed as inference engines capable of answering a variety of environment-related queries.  
2. It highlights that agents trained in deterministic settings inherently develop rich internal knowledge about aspects such as reachability, distances, values, and dynamics, but current RL architectures fail to efficiently expose this embedded knowledge.  
3. To address this, the authors introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that handles multiple query types—policy, reachability, paths, comparisons—through specialized neural modules tailored to different inference needs.  
4. A key empirical finding is the observed decoupling between inference accuracy and control performance: QDIN achieves near-perfect inference accuracy (99% reachability IoU) even when the control performance is suboptimal (31% return), suggesting distinct underlying representations for knowledge versus control.  
5. Experimental results show that query-specialized architectures outperform both unified models and techniques that extract information post-hoc, while still maintaining competitive control capabilities. This work proposes a new research direction for creating RL systems inherently designed as queryable knowledge bases, enhancing interpretability, verification, and enabling better human-AI collaboration. <div>
arXiv:2511.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

<div> POMDP, piecewise-linear-convex, value function, neural networks, value iteration<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The article addresses the challenge of solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), whose value functions are piecewise-linear and convex (PWLC) and traditionally represented by a finite set of high-dimensional $\alpha$-vectors.<br /><br />2. Conventional point-based value iteration methods work by performing Bellman backups on these $\alpha$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence but face scalability issues due to the computational cost growing with the state space size.<br /><br />3. The authors propose a novel representation of the POMDP value function as a finite set of neural networks, leveraging the PWLC property in a new way.<br /><br />4. This approach, named Neural Value Iteration, integrates the generalization ability and flexibility of neural networks into the classical value iteration framework, overcoming scalability barriers.<br /><br />5. Empirical results indicate that Neural Value Iteration achieves near-optimal solutions even for extremely large POMDPs where existing offline solvers become computationally infeasible, offering a promising direction for large-scale POMDP planning. <div>
arXiv:2511.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $\alpha$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $\alpha$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $\alpha$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

<div> Keywords: large language models, educational settings, reinforcement learning, cognitive optimization, interactive dialogue

Summary:
The article introduces the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method for large language models (LLMs) acting as intelligent tutors in educational settings. Current supervised fine-tuning methods lack dynamic adaptation capabilities, while reinforcement learning approaches face challenges in evaluating teaching effectiveness and perceiving students' evolving cognitive states. UCO addresses these challenges by utilizing a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm with two synergistic reward functions: Progress Reward and Scaffold Reward. The Progress Reward evaluates students' cognitive advancement, distinguishing genuine understanding from echoing teacher-provided answers, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Experimental results on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks show that UCO outperforms baseline models and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data for UCO are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

<div> Keywords: bioacoustic AI, recursive cognition, communication, contingency, model design <br />
Summary: 
This article explores the interaction between bioacoustic AI systems and the communicative processes of different species. It argues that AI systems, with their attention mechanisms and feedback loops, may distort or obscure the communicative structures of other species due to their own information processing biases. This creates a challenge of double contingency, where each species' communication is influenced by ecological and evolutionary factors, while AI systems interpret these signals based on their own architectural and training conditions. The author suggests a shift from universal pattern recognition to a more diplomatic approach that acknowledges the recursive cognitive abilities of both AI systems and other species. This reimagining has implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies in the field of bioacoustic AI. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Summary: <br />Time series forecasting is essential in various critical domains like energy and healthcare. Current approaches lack the interactive and adaptive abilities of human experts. AlphaCast introduces a novel framework that facilitates collaboration between human wisdom and Large Language Model intelligence to enhance forecasting accuracy. The framework comprises two stages: automated prediction preparation and generative reasoning with reflective optimization. AlphaCast leverages a multi-source cognitive foundation and integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies to continuously refine predictions through a meta-reasoning loop. Experimental results demonstrate that AlphaCast outperforms existing baselines in predictive accuracy.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Summary:
Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) faces challenges in exact computation of extensions under stable semantics for large frameworks. This study introduces the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. Two GNN architectures, ABAGCN and ABAGAT, are proposed to learn node embeddings in ABA frameworks represented as dependency graphs. The models outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on benchmark instances. Additionally, a sound extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by the GNN predictor reconstructs stable extensions with high accuracy on small ABAFs and maintains effectiveness on larger frameworks. This research paves the way for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their fluency but lack strong reasoning capabilities. This paper proposes a systematic framework for enhancing LLM reasoning by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to traverse the search space gradually, incrementally, and sequentially (GIS). The authors advocate for controlled, incremental search as the key to high-quality reasoning. They test this framework by comparing a simple linear pipeline to a complex one that incorporates recursive refinement (RR). In an experiment using historical personas of US Founding Fathers as models, the complex model consistently outperforms the simple model in generating responses to contemporary political issues. Evaluation by an LLM arbiter agent and human judgment shows that the complex model excels in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. The study concludes that recursive refinement is a powerful method for enhancing LLM reasoning through GIS search.<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models lack robust reasoning capabilities, prompting the development of a multi-agent pipeline framework for controlled, incremental search. Implementing recursive refinement enhances reasoning, as shown in a comparison experiment with historical personas.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Summary: <br />
The paper discusses the limitations of current LLMs in performing tasks with long sequences of logical steps, citing the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain as an example. The proposed solution, MAKER, successfully solves tasks with over one million LLM steps with zero errors by extreme decomposition into subtasks and utilizing microagents for focused processing. Error correction is applied at each step through a multi-agent voting scheme, ensuring scalability. The study suggests that massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) offer an efficient way to solve complex problems at the level of organizations and societies, highlighting the potential of this approach over continual improvement of current LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2511.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

<div> Keywords: autonomous driving systems, resilience, hazard mitigation, end-to-end ADS, safety violations<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring resilience in end-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs) operating on public roads where diverse hazards threaten safety and performance. The authors propose Argus, a runtime resilience-oriented framework designed to continuously monitor the ADS-generated vehicle trajectories for potential hazards. When the system detects unsafe situations involving the EGO vehicle, Argus intervenes through a hazard mitigator module that seamlessly takes control to prevent safety violations. The framework is integrated with three leading end-to-end ADS models: TCP, UniAD, and VAD, demonstrating compatibility and generalizability. Experimental evaluations reveal that Argus significantly improves the resilience and safety of these ADSs, boosting their driving scores by an average of up to 150.30% and reducing safety violations by as much as 64.38%. Importantly, these substantial safety improvements come with minimal additional computational overhead, showing that runtime monitoring and adaptive control can be practically deployed. Overall, Argus represents a promising approach toward robust, safe autonomous driving in complex, real-world scenarios by enabling continuous hazard detection and adaptive intervention to maintain stable and secure driving behaviors. <div>
arXiv:2511.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Summary: 
OR-R1 is a data-efficient framework for automated optimization modeling and solving that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) to achieve state-of-the-art performance. By leveraging both limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, OR-R1 surpasses existing methods like ORLM in solving accuracy while requiring significantly less synthetic data. With just 100 synthetic samples, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over 2.4%. TGRPO further improves accuracy, narrowing the performance gap between single-attempt and multi-attempt solving. This approach provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for industrial OR applications, reducing expertise and data barriers. Extensive evaluations across various real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OR-R1 in automating optimization modeling and solving.

arXiv:2511.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, GUI automation, episodic reasoning, History-Aware Reasoning (HAR), Reinforcement Learning

<br /><br />Summary:  
Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have notably improved Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation by enhancing agents' reasoning capabilities over extended task sequences. Effective episodic reasoning, which links user task descriptions to complex real-world executions, remains challenging. Existing approaches combine Reinforcement Learning with System-2 Chain-of-Thought reasoning but suffer from weak short-term memory, treating each screen interaction independently without historic context awareness. This history-agnostic reasoning limits agents' performance in long-horizon GUI tasks. To address this, the authors propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework designed to bolster short-term memory by enabling agents to reflect on errors and learn from episodic knowledge. The framework includes creating reflective learning scenarios, generating tailored corrective guidelines, and implementing a hybrid reinforcement learning reward function. Using HAR, the authors develop HAR-GUI-3B, an end-to-end model that shifts from history-agnostic to history-aware reasoning, thereby improving the agent's memory stability and perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple GUI benchmarks demonstrate HAR-GUI-3B’s enhanced effectiveness and generalization capabilities in long-horizon GUI automation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ProBench, a mobile benchmark containing over 200 challenging GUI tasks. It addresses the limitation of traditional benchmarks in evaluating GUI agents by incorporating Process-related Tasks and introducing a Process Provider for accurate process information. The evaluation of advanced GUI agents using ProBench reveals significant shortcomings in real-world scenarios, irrespective of model size or specialization. These findings are supported by a detailed error analysis, which highlights common problems and suggests areas for future improvement. ProBench offers a more comprehensive evaluation method for GUI agents, focusing on capturing the entire process rather than just the final screen state. <div>

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, Large language models, Conciseness Reward Model, Conciseness Reward Function, Mathematical benchmark datasets

Summary:
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been utilized to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), leading to the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs often face the issue of generating verbose and redundant responses, known as overthinking, which escalates computational costs. Existing solutions incorporating length penalties in the reward function encounter problems like length collapse and training collapse, hampering performance. To tackle these challenges, a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) is proposed to evaluate the conciseness of reasoning paths. A novel Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) is introduced with a clear relationship between outcome reward and conciseness score to promote effective and efficient reasoning. The method exhibits superior variance reduction and convergence properties theoretically. Practical experiments on mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and token efficiency, achieving notable accuracy improvement and response token length reduction on Qwen2.5-7B. The approach shows promising generalization to other LLMs like Llama and Mistral. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

<div> Keywords: agentic AI systems, reliability challenges, out-of-distribution detection, AI transparency, human operator intervention  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The article addresses the implementation of agentic AI systems, which operate autonomously with minimal external control to achieve defined goals. These systems offer potential benefits across various applications but currently suffer from insufficient reliability, making them risky for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and industrial processes. The authors identify and analyze the key reliability challenges encountered during the operation of agentic AI systems, highlighting a fundamental reliability issue that is also present in traditional AI systems. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes a novel two-layered reliability monitoring framework. The first layer involves out-of-distribution detection to identify novel or unexpected inputs that may lead to unreliable outputs. The second layer focuses on AI transparency to expose the internal workings of the system. Together, these layers support human operators by providing critical information to assess the reliability of outputs and to decide when intervention is necessary. This approach aims to mitigate risks associated with uncertain behavior and unreliable decisions by agentic AI during operation. Ultimately, the framework lays the groundwork for future mitigation strategies to enhance the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous AI systems in sensitive applications. <div>

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

<div> Embedding Fusion, Clinical Time Series, Electronic Health Records, Irregular Sampling, Multiplicative Modulation<br />
Summary:<br />
- The article introduces MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series analysis using a Multiplicative Embedding Fusion (MuFuse) module.
- MedFuse combines feature and value embeddings through multiplicative modulation to capture value-dependent feature interactions and higher-order dependencies across features.
- Experimental results on real-world datasets in intensive and chronic care settings show that MedFuse outperforms existing methods on predictive tasks.
- Analysis of learned representations demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances model expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining.
- MedFuse is deemed a generalizable approach for effectively modeling irregular clinical time series data. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

<div> Hybrid Periodic Decoupling, Traffic Forecasting, Spatial Dependencies, Multi-Scale Periodic Patterns, HyperD <br />
<br />
Summary: Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, challenges arise from complex spatial dependencies and the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns with irregular fluctuations. To address these, the HyperD framework is proposed. It decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components, handling fine-grained patterns with a Hybrid Periodic Representation Module and high-frequency fluctuations with a Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module. A Dual-View Alignment Loss enforces semantic separation. HyperD outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, as shown in experiments on real-world traffic datasets. <div>
arXiv:2511.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

<title>From Model Training to Model Raising - A call to reform AI model training paradigms from post-hoc alignment to intrinsic, identity-based development</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09287</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: AI training, model raising, alignment, training corpus, values<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article proposes a shift from traditional AI model training to a new approach of "model raising," where alignment with human values is integrated into the model's development process. This involves redesigning the training corpus to include components like reframing data from a first-person perspective, contextualizing information as lived experiences, simulating social interactions, and organizing the order of training data. By incorporating values into the model's early stages, a deeper and more intrinsic commitment to values is established throughout the model's development. This paradigm shift is seen as essential as AI models are becoming more advanced and capable of surpassing human abilities in various tasks. <div>
arXiv:2511.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, qualitative research, large language models, interpretive methods, reproducibility<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed quantitative scientific methods but have not been equally adopted in qualitative research.<br />2. Researchers in qualitative fields remain cautious about AI use due to concerns over bias, lack of transparency, reproducibility issues, and privacy risks inherent in general-purpose AI tools such as ChatGPT.<br />3. Currently, qualitative researchers who do use AI often rely on tools not specifically designed for interpretive tasks, leading to a critical gap in AI integration for qualitative meaning-making.<br />4. The authors advocate for the development of dedicated qualitative AI systems designed from the ground up to meet the unique needs of qualitative research, emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and privacy protection.<br />5. By reviewing recent literature, the paper highlights how such specialized qualitative AI can strengthen automated scientific discovery pipelines and foster advancements in multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research, thereby bridging existing gaps and enabling comprehensive scientific understanding. <div>
arXiv:2511.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

<div> Safety verification, dynamical systems, barrier certificates, language model, synthesis

Summary:
Barrier certificates are crucial for safety verification in autonomous systems. Current methods for synthesizing these certificates are limited in scalability and require manual expertise. This study proposes an agentic framework that uses natural language reasoning to generate, refine, and validate safety certificates. The framework combines language model-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification and supports barrier-controller co-synthesis. A benchmark called BarrierBench comprising 100 dynamical systems is introduced to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Results show that the framework achieves over 90% success in generating valid certificates. The use of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies further improves reliability and performance. By releasing BarrierBench and its toolchain, the study aims to promote the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.

The study evaluates the planning performance of three cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) - DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-5 - in generating plans from PDDL domain and task descriptions as of 2025. Results show that GPT-5's performance in solving tasks on standard PDDL domains is competitive with the planner LAMA. When domains and tasks are obfuscated to test pure reasoning, all LLMs experience a performance drop, though less severe than previous models. The study indicates significant advancements in LLM capabilities, narrowing the performance gap to traditional planners on challenging benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

This new method introduced in the article utilizes latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance to disentangle latent subspaces. It explicitly separates information included in conditioning from information in the residual representation, enabling access to meaningful features of high-dimensional data. The method was tested on a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations. The results showcase a straightforward yet powerful approach for accessing information in learned representations, opening up possibilities for using generative models in scientific exploration of unconsidered or uncataloged data.

<div> Keywords: CrochetBench, multimodal large language models, procedural reasoning, CrochetPARADE DSL, executable correctness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. CrochetBench is introduced as a novel benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' ability to perform detailed, low-level procedural reasoning within the specialized domain of crochet.<br /><br />2. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily emphasize high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench focuses on practical action by requiring models to recognize specific crochet stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate crochet procedures that are compilable.<br /><br />3. The benchmark uses the CrochetPARADE Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as an intermediate representation, which allows for structural validation and functional evaluation through the execution of generated procedures.<br /><br />4. Tasks covered by CrochetBench include stitch classification, instruction grounding, and translating both natural language and images into the CrochetPARADE DSL.<br /><br />5. Experimental results demonstrate that model performance significantly worsens when evaluations move beyond surface-level textual similarity to measures of executable correctness, revealing current limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.<br /><br />6. CrochetBench thus provides a new perspective for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the existing gap between understanding and generating executable, precise instructions within real-world creative domains. <div>

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

<div> approach, AI safety, generative models, consensus sampling algorithm, model aggregation
Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to enhance AI safety by aggregating multiple generative models. This architecture-agnostic method aims to mitigate inherent risks that are undetectable through inspection alone. The proposed consensus sampling algorithm leverages the output probabilities of k models to achieve risk competitiveness with the safest s models among them. The algorithm abstains when there is insufficient agreement between models, ensuring safety in decision-making. Inspired by a copyright protection algorithm, the approach requires overlap among safe models but offers no protection if all models are unsafe. While the algorithm may accumulate risk over repeated use, it provides a model-agnostic strategy to amplify safety guarantees within a collection of models, ultimately enhancing overall AI safety measures. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

<div> Physical AI, embodiment, sensory perception, learning, autonomy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article presents the fundamental principles of Physical Artificial Intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic viewpoint, aiming to establish a theoretical foundation that integrates physical embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity. Unlike classical AI, which relies on symbolic processing and data-driven models, Physical AI conceptualizes intelligence as an emergent phenomenon resulting from real interactions between the body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals are not isolated modules but constitute a closed control loop involving continuous exchanges of energy, information, control, and context, enabling the generation of meaning through physical experience rather than database-driven computation. Learning is redefined as modifying the structural coupling between agent and environment instead of mere parameter tuning. To contextualize the theory, the article uses an example of an adaptive assistant robot in a rehabilitation clinic, demonstrating how Physical AI operates in practice: embodiment is essential, perception provides input, movement serves as expression, learning leads to adaptation, autonomy facilitates regulation, and context provides orientation. This paradigm shift highlights intelligence as an embodied, interactive, and adaptive process deeply rooted in physical reality rather than abstract calculation. <div>
arXiv:2511.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

2. Applying adversarial optimization naively in cooperative settings causes agents to self-sabotage, preventing task completion and stopping learning progress.  
3. To fix this, the authors propose Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), which ensures agents remain rational by maintaining policies optimal with respect to some possible partner policy, thus avoiding self-sabotage.  
4. They develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG) to solve RPO by training agents to maximize their own reward in a modified game that incorporates opponent shaping to optimize adversarial objectives.  
5. RPG allows existing adversarial optimization methods to be extended effectively to cooperative and general-sum environments, improving robustness, adaptability, and diversity of learned policies.  
6. The approach is empirically validated to achieve strong performance in several popular multi-agent cooperative and general-sum environments.

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

<div> Keywords: Greedy Best-First Search, Enforced Hill-Climbing, Uninformed Heuristic Regions, breadth-first search, restarting random walks<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses challenges faced by greedy search algorithms, specifically Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC), when navigating Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs), such as heuristic local minima and plateaus.<br /><br />2. Two primary methods for escaping UHRs are analyzed: breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). The study provides a theoretical comparison based on the expected runtime to escape UHRs using each method.<br /><br />3. The expected runtime calculations incorporate both the characteristics of UHRs and the nature of the random walk procedures, leading to criteria that predict when RRWs outperform BrFS in expectation.<br /><br />4. The work introduces a variant of EHC, called EHC-RRW, which employs RRWs instead of BrFS to escape UHRs. EHC-RRW demonstrates strong expected runtime guarantees similar to or better than standard EHC in situations where EHC has been proven effective.<br /><br />5. Empirical evaluations are conducted on PDDL planning benchmarks to compare the practical effectiveness of EHC and EHC-RRW, providing insights into their performance differences and practical applicability in escaping UHRs during planning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

<div> Keywords: Long-term Time Series Forecasting, Transformer, Multi-layer Perceptron, Contextual Motif Extraction, Forecasting module

Summary:
CometNet addresses the receptive field bottleneck in Long-term Time Series Forecasting models by introducing a Contextual Motif Extraction module to identify dominant contextual motifs in historical sequences. These motifs provide extensive temporal dependencies, improving long-term forecasting capabilities. The Motif-guided Forecasting module then integrates these dominant motifs for more accurate predictions. Compared to existing Transformer- and MLP-based methods, CometNet significantly outperforms on real-world datasets, especially on extended forecast horizons. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to relevant motifs, CometNet effectively leverages contextual information for improved forecasting performance. The framework successfully overcomes limitations of finite look-back windows, offering a more robust solution for long-term time series forecasting.

Abstract: Long-term Time Series Forecasting is crucial across numerous critical domains, yet its accuracy remains fundamentally constrained by the receptive field bottleneck in existing models. Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.

<div> Housing cooperative, decision-making autonomy, energy consumption, Conversational agents, SPARA <br />
Summary: Housing cooperatives in Sweden face challenges in managing energy consumption and meeting EU energy directives. A conversational agent system, SPARA, has been developed to provide energy efficiency advice to cooperative members. SPARA uses the RAG framework with a Language Model to generate targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base of email communications. Preliminary results show SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with 80% precision, comparable to municipal energy efficiency experts. A pilot implementation is ongoing to evaluate SPARA's performance. Further research is needed to assess the technology's limitations and trustworthiness in providing energy efficiency advice. Overall, conversational agents like SPARA have the potential to support stakeholders in their energy transition efforts. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Housing cooperative is a common type of multifamily building ownership in Sweden. Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.

Summary: This paper examines automatic methods for attribution in summary generation. The focus is on linking each sentence in the summary back to the original source text to ensure proper sourcing. A hybrid summarization approach is proposed, combining extractive summaries with automatic paraphrasing to facilitate attribution. The study also employs a custom topology to analyze different categories of attribution-related errors and their proportions. The goal is to provide analysts with reliable tools for attributing information, highlighting the importance of accurate sourcing in reporting. <div>

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, social media, conversations, authenticity, simulation

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to simulate online communities and social media interactions. The study tested the ability of LLMs, specifically Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o, to generate conversations on Reddit topics that could deceive humans. Results showed that LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39% of the time. Participants were only able to correctly identify AI-generated conversations 56% of the time, indicating a high level of realism in the LLM-generated content. This suggests that LLMs have the capability to authentically mimic human group conversations on social media platforms. However, the study also raises concerns about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate inauthentic social media content. These findings highlight both the promise of LLMs for social simulation and the need to be cautious about their use in generating deceptive online interactions. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) can convincingly simulate human group conversations on social media, with participants often unable to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created content. This raises both the potential for realistic social simulation and the risk of misuse in generating inauthentic online interactions. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

Summary: 
Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP) is introduced as a lightweight method to enhance the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing semantic redundancy during tree-of-thought reasoning. SSDP integrates online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, allowing for real-time clustering and pruning of redundant steps. Across various reasoning benchmarks, SSDP achieves a significant speedup of up to 2.3x compared to state-of-the-art tree-search methods while maintaining competitive accuracy levels, typically within 5% of the strongest baseline. Additionally, SSDP reduces the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating its practical approach to efficient and scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available on GitHub, making it accessible for further research and development.

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning.

Summary:
The paper introduces a framework for evaluating the factual fidelity of large language models (LLMs) when subjected to adversarial nudges. The framework involves instructing the LLM to generate truths and lies within a closed domain, verifying these assertions, and testing the model's resilience against the lies it generated. Evaluation using five popular LLMs across movie and novel domains shows varying levels of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: Claude exhibits strong resilience, GPT and Grok show moderate resilience, while Gemini and DeepSeek display weak resilience. The findings are concerning as LLMs are increasingly used by a large population for information seeking.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Self-HarmLLM, Mitigated Harmful Query, Jailbreak, Guardrail Evaluation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study introduces the Self-HarmLLM scenario, highlighting a novel attack vector where a Large Language Model (LLM) generates a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) that preserves harmful intent but is ambiguous enough to bypass initial guardrails. The MHQ is then re-submitted to the same or a separate session of the LLM to test whether it triggers a jailbreak or harmful output. Experiments were conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models under different prompting conditions: Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot. Results showed a transformation success rate as high as 65% and jailbreak success rates up to 41% in Few-shot conditions, demonstrating that the model’s own output can become an internal attack vector. Additionally, the study revealed that automated, prefix-based evaluation methods significantly overestimate jailbreak success by roughly 52% compared to human evaluators, suggesting that current automatic evaluations are unreliable for accurately assessing harmfulness. While the research is preliminary and based on a limited set of queries and evaluators, it underscores the threat from self-generated harmful queries and calls for a fundamental redesign of guardrail mechanisms and more robust evaluation methodologies to ensure LLM safety. <div>
arXiv:2511.08597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

2. It introduces Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), an innovative, fully automated framework designed to generate high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand, focusing primarily on the rapidly evolving news domain.  
3. OKBench utilizes an agentic approach that automates the processes of sourcing, creating, validating, and distributing benchmarks, thereby democratizing benchmark generation and enabling more frequent and up-to-date assessments of LLMs.  
4. The framework supports thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented LLM methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data, which is crucial for assessing how models handle fresh, unseen information.  
5. Experimental results demonstrate distinct behaviors in LLMs when dealing with new knowledge and reveal that retrieval augmentation significantly reduces performance disparities between smaller and larger models, emphasizing the importance of dynamic, evolving knowledge benchmarks for comprehensive LLM evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Unlike prior methods for identifying stochastic differential equations that typically rely on the ergodicity assumption and require large datasets, the proposed framework uniquely eliminates the need for ergodicity by leveraging the risk-neutral measure. This advancement allows for the recovery of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) from only a single pair of stock and option trajectory data, thus making analysis feasible with limited financial time series data. The methodology empowers users to not only perform forward-looking predictions about financial behavior but also to generate new synthetic data paths that are consistent with the identified underlying probabilistic law. By integrating financial modeling with data-driven discovery, this approach offers a powerful tool to improve understanding and forecasting of market dynamics under the risk-neutral framework, which is especially valuable in financial contexts where data scarcity and non-ergodicity present significant challenges. <div>

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&amp;ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

<div> framework, Verbal Technical Analysis, stock forecasts, time-series, interpretability

Summary:<br />
The article proposes a novel framework called Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA) that combines verbal and latent reasoning to generate stock forecasts that are accurate and interpretable. The challenge lies in the switch between the time-series domain of stock price data and the natural language reasoning required for analysis. VTA converts stock price data into textual annotations for reasoning and optimizes the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. The framework conditions the outputs of a time-series model on reasoning-based attributes to generate accurate forecasts. Experiment results on U.S., Chinese, and European stock market datasets demonstrate that VTA achieves superior forecasting accuracy while also performing well in reasoning trace evaluations by industry experts. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.

Keywords: large language models, supervised fine-tuning, gradient-aware data selection, catastrophic forgetting, domain specialization  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) large language models (LLMs) for domain specialization, which often require significant resources and risk degrading general performance due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To tackle these issues, the authors propose GrADS, a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection method that identifies the most effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients during a preliminary training phase. GrADS uses self-guided criteria based on gradient magnitude and statistical distribution to prioritize data samples that most significantly contribute to learning. This approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve LLM understanding in specialized domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Experimental results demonstrate that using only 5% of the data selected by GrADS enables models to outperform those trained on the full dataset, and further increasing to 50% yields considerable performance gains. Importantly, GrADS also effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, preserving LLMs' general capabilities while enabling domain adaptation. The paper highlights the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this technique and notes that the authors plan to release the GrADS code publicly. <div>

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, financial domain, multi-period learning framework, accuracy, efficiency

Summary:
The paper introduces a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) for enhancing accuracy and efficiency in financial time series forecasting (TSF). The framework includes modules such as Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF) for accurate self-attention modeling, Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI) for effective integration of multi-period forecasts, and Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP) to mitigate bias towards certain periods. Additionally, a Patch Squeeze module reduces the number of patches in self-attention modeling for increased efficiency. MLF allows for the incorporation of multiple inputs with varying lengths, improving accuracy while reducing training costs. The proposed framework aims to address the challenges faced by current TSF models in handling multi-period characteristics, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in financial time series forecasting. The codes and datasets related to the study are openly accessible on GitHub for further research and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel framework called Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO) to address the computational challenges of multiphase flow systems. IANO leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance prediction accuracy, using an interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism and a geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism. This enables capturing high-frequency physical features at the interface and achieving pointwise super-resolution prediction even with limited data. Experimental results show that IANO outperforms traditional solvers by approximately 10% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations, while remaining robust in low-data and noise-perturbed conditions. <div>

Abstract: Multiphase flow systems, with their complex dynamics, field discontinuities, and interphase interactions, pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical solvers. While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\'echet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

Summary:
The study focused on measuring educational aspirations among women learning programming in Afghanistan amidst systemic educational restrictions. The adaptation of Snyder's Hope Scale proved to be a reliable metric, with participants finding it understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration scores did not differ significantly based on access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access showed slightly higher scores on the Avenues subscale, indicating broader pathways to achieving their educational goals. The findings suggest that the adapted scale can effectively measure aspirations in challenging socio-political contexts and support aspiration-driven design of educational technologies. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding and measuring aspirations in designing impactful educational interventions, especially in contexts of instability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Designing impactful educational technologies in contexts of socio-political instability requires a nuanced understanding of educational aspirations. Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's {\alpha} = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations. These findings support the use of the adapted scale as a metric for aspirations in contexts of socio-political instability. More broadly, the adapted scale can be used to evaluate the impact of aspiration-driven design of educational technologies.

<div> Diffusion, video generation, motion control, image-to-video, dual-clock denoising<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces Time-to-Move (TTM), a novel framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation using image-to-video diffusion models. Unlike prior techniques that require costly fine-tuning, TTM functions as a training-free and plug-and-play solution, enabling seamless integration with existing models. The approach leverages crude reference animations created through simple user manipulations, such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection, to provide coarse motion cues. Inspired by SDEdit's document for image editing, TTM adapts this idea for video by combining appearance conditioning with a novel dual-clock denoising strategy. This region-dependent denoising enforces strong alignment in motion-specified areas while allowing flexibility in others, striking a balance between adhering to user intent and preserving natural video dynamics. The method incurs no extra training or runtime costs and is compatible with any diffusion backbone architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TTM matches or outperforms existing training-based baselines in both realism and motion control on benchmarks involving object and camera motions. Furthermore, TTM introduces unique pixel-level appearance control capabilities, surpassing limitations of text-based prompts. The authors provide a project page with video examples and source code for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Abstract: The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.

Abstract: Academic publishing increasingly requires authors to disclose AI assistance, yet imposes reputational costs for doing so--especially when such assistance is substantial. This article analyzes that structural contradiction, showing how incentives discourage transparency in precisely the work where it matters most. Traditional venues cannot resolve this tension through policy tweaks alone, as the underlying prestige economy rewards opacity. To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation.

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate fluence map prediction is essential in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Conventional optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise. This study presents a deep learning framework that accelerates fluence map generation while maintaining clinical quality. An end-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network was trained to predict nine-beam fluence maps directly from volumetric CT images and anatomical contours using 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 for training and 20 for testing). The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The proposed model achieved an average R^2 of 0.95 +/- 0.02, MAE of 0.035 +/- 0.008, and gamma passing rate of 85 +/- 10 percent (3 percent / 3 mm) on the test set, with no significant differences observed in DVH parameters between predicted and clinical plans. The Swin-UNETR framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction directly from anatomical inputs, enhancing spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency while offering a scalable and consistent solution for automated IMRT plan generation.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, yet development timelines of 8-12 years and clinical attrition rates exceeding 40-60% highlight critical inefficiencies in target selection, safety assessment, and molecular optimization. We present Bio AI Agent, a multi-agent artificial intelligence system powered by large language models that enables autonomous CAR-T development through collaborative specialized agents. The system comprises six autonomous agents: Target Selection Agent for multi-parametric antigen prioritization across >10,000 cancer-associated targets, Toxicity Prediction Agent for comprehensive safety profiling integrating tissue expression atlases and pharmacovigilance databases, Molecular Design Agent for rational CAR engineering, Patent Intelligence Agent for freedom-to-operate analysis, Clinical Translation Agent for regulatory compliance, and Decision Orchestration Agent for multi-agent coordination. Retrospective validation demonstrated autonomous identification of high-risk targets including FcRH5 (hepatotoxicity) and CD229 (off-tumor toxicity), patent infringement risks for CD38+SLAMF7 combinations, and generation of comprehensive development roadmaps. By enabling parallel processing, specialized reasoning, and autonomous decision-making superior to monolithic AI systems, Bio AI Agent addresses critical gaps in precision oncology development and has potential to accelerate translation of next-generation immunotherapies from discovery to clinic.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion</title>

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Abstract: This paper analyses AI-generated podcasts produced by Google's NotebookLM, which generates audio podcasts with two chatty AI hosts discussing whichever documents a user uploads. While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: This book is an introductory textbook targeted towards computer science students who are completely new to the topic of automated negotiation. It does not require any prerequisite knowledge, except for elementary mathematics and basic programming skills.
  This book comes with an simple toy-world negotiation framework implemented in Python that can be used by the readers to implement their own negotiation algorithms and perform experiments with them. This framework is small and simple enough that any reader who does not like to work in Python should be able to re-implement it very quickly in any other programming language of their choice.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is a promising approach to tackle the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. However, since Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data, the lack of diverse and up-to-date datasets hinders their generalization capability to detect malicious activity in previously unseen network traffic. This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the GeNIS dataset supports intelligent intrusion detection and cyberattack classification with time-based and quantity-based behavioral features.

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

<title>FAIRPLAI: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Fair and Private Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

<title>Benevolent Dictators? On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games</title>

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies. Our code artifacts are available at https://github.com/andreaseinwiller/LLM-ABS.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL. All codes can be found here: https://github.com/Nikunj-Gupta/tiger-marl.

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Abstract: AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.

<title>Rethinking Graph Super-resolution: Dual Frameworks for Topological Fidelity</title>

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

<title>When is a System Discoverable from Data? Discovery Requires Chaos</title>

Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

Abstract: Detecting the origin of information or infection spread in networks is a fundamental challenge with applications in misinformation tracking, epidemiology, and beyond. We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves rigorous coverage with competitive accuracy, outperforming existing baselines in both reliability and scalability.The code is available online.

<title>SasMamba: A Lightweight Structure-Aware Stride State Space Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08872</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

<title>Hallucinate or Memorize? The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&amp;E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the high cost of large language model (LLM) training from scratch, safeguarding LLM intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly crucial. As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.

<title>Diffusion Policies with Value-Conditional Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we introduce Deep VRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures. All the code, fine-tuned models, and an interactive data portal are publicly available.

<title>FedSDWC: Federated Synergistic Dual-Representation Weak Causal Learning for OOD</title>

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Healthcare federated learning requires strong privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency across resource-constrained medical institutions. This paper presents MedHE, a novel framework combining adaptive gradient sparsification with CKKS homomorphic encryption to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning on sensitive medical data. Our approach introduces a dynamic threshold mechanism with error compensation for top-k gradient selection, achieving 97.5 percent communication reduction while preserving model utility. We provide formal security analysis under Ring Learning with Errors assumptions and demonstrate differential privacy guarantees with epsilon less than or equal to 1.0. Statistical testing across 5 independent trials shows MedHE achieves 89.5 percent plus or minus 0.8 percent accuracy, maintaining comparable performance to standard federated learning (p=0.32) while reducing communication from 1277 MB to 32 MB per training round. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates practical feasibility for real-world medical deployments with HIPAA compliance and scalability to 100 plus institutions.

<title>Break the Tie: Learning Cluster-Customized Category Relationships for Categorical Data Clustering</title>

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

<title>PAN: A World Model for General, Interactable, and Long-Horizon World Simulation</title>

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

<title>Good-for-MDP State Reduction for Stochastic LTL Planning</title>

Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.

Abstract: This paper introduces Tele-LLM-Hub, a user friendly low-code solution for rapid prototyping and deployment of context aware multi-agent (MA) Large Language Model (LLM) systems tailored for 5G and beyond. As telecom wireless networks become increasingly complex, intelligent LLM applications must share a domainspecific understanding of network state. We propose TeleMCP, the Telecom Model Context Protocol, to enable structured and context-rich communication between agents in telecom environments. Tele-LLM-Hub actualizes TeleMCP through a low-code interface that supports agent creation, workflow composition, and interaction with software stacks such as srsRAN. Key components include a direct chat interface, a repository of pre-built systems, an Agent Maker leveraging finetuning with our RANSTRUCT framework, and an MA-Maker for composing MA workflows. The goal of Tele-LLM-Hub is to democratize the design of contextaware MA systems and accelerate innovation in next-generation wireless networks.

<title>Improving Sustainability of Adversarial Examples in Class-Incremental Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09088</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.

<title>Diff-V2M: A Hierarchical Conditional Diffusion Model with Explicit Rhythmic Modeling for Video-to-Music Generation</title>

Abstract: Video-to-music (V2M) generation aims to create music that aligns with visual content. However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons. Demo and code are available at https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo/.

<title>Factorization-in-Loop: Proximal Fill-in Minimization for Sparse Matrix Reordering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.09093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

Abstract: Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

<title>Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. Conditioning WFOMC on evidence -- fixing the truth values of a set of ground literals -- has been shown impossible in time polynomial in the domain size (unless $\mathsf{\#P \subseteq FP}$) even for fragments of logic that are otherwise tractable for WFOMC without evidence. In this work, we address the barrier by restricting the binary evidence to the case where the underlying Gaifman graph has bounded treewidth. We present a polynomial-time algorithm in the domain size for computing WFOMC for the two-variable fragments $\text{FO}^2$ and $\text{C}^2$ conditioned on such binary evidence. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our algorithm in combinatorial problems by solving the stable seating arrangement problem on bounded-treewidth graphs of bounded degree, which was an open problem. We also conducted experiments to show the scalability of our algorithm compared to the existing model counting solvers.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Abstract: PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.

Abstract: Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.

Abstract: Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

<title>Unveiling Hidden Threats: Using Fractal Triggers to Boost Stealthiness of Distributed Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Traditional distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) in federated learning improve stealthiness by decomposing global triggers into sub-triggers, which however requires more poisoned data to maintian the attck strength and hence increases the exposure risk. To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\% attack success rate with only 62.4\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\% and KL divergence by 41.2\%. This study presents a low-exposure, high-efficiency paradigm for federated backdoor attacks and expands the application of fractal features in adversarial sample generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: Measuring GUI task difficulty is crucial for user behavior analysis and agent capability evaluation. Yet, existing benchmarks typically quantify difficulty based on motor actions (e.g., step counts), overlooking the cognitive demands underlying task completion. In this work, we propose Cognitive Chain, a novel framework that models task difficulty from a cognitive perspective. A cognitive chain decomposes the cognitive processes preceding a motor action into a sequence of cognitive steps (e.g., finding, deciding, computing), each with a difficulty index grounded in information theories. We develop an LLM-based method to automatically extract cognitive chains from task execution traces. Validation with linear regression shows that our estimated cognitive difficulty correlates well with user completion time (step-level R-square=0.46 after annotation). Assessment of state-of-the-art GUI agents shows reduced success on cognitively demanding tasks, revealing capability gaps and Human-AI consistency patterns. We conclude by discussing potential applications in agent training, capability assessment, and human-agent delegation optimization.

<title>Distribution-Based Feature Attribution for Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

<title>Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets</title>

Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

<title>A general framework for adaptive nonparametric dimensionality reduction</title>

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

<title>Enhancing Password Security Through a High-Accuracy Scoring Framework Using Random Forests</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09492</link>

Abstract: Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.

<title>DreamPose3D: Hallucinative Diffusion with Prompt Learning for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09502</link>

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper investigates how individual entrepreneurs can turn creative ideas into successful solo businesses in an era increasingly shaped by Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. It highlights the key steps that connect personal vision, structured experimentation, and lasting value creation, and shows how AI agents can act as digital co-founders throughout this journey. Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows. We focus on the specific context of solopreneurship, characterized by limited human resources, complete accountability for decision-making, and a strong association between the founder's identity and the business. The framework clearly identifies key enabling factors such as mental adaptability, effective planning, and successful human-AI collaboration within digital ecosystems. It also thoughtfully addresses ongoing challenges, like uncertainty and cognitive overload, which are heightened by our constant connectivity.

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

Abstract: Scoring rules evaluate probabilistic forecasts of an unknown state against the realized state and are a fundamental building block in the incentivized elicitation of information. This paper develops mechanisms for scoring elicited text against ground truth text by reducing the textual information elicitation problem to a forecast elicitation problem, via domain-knowledge-free queries to a large language model (specifically ChatGPT), and empirically evaluates their alignment with human preferences. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reduction achieves provable properness via black-box language models. The empirical evaluation is conducted on peer reviews from a peer-grading dataset, in comparison to manual instructor scores for the peer reviews.
  Our results suggest a paradigm of algorithmic artificial intelligence that may be useful for developing artificial intelligence technologies with provable guarantees.

Abstract: We make three contributions. First, we formulate a discussion-graph semantics for first-order logic with equality, enabling reasoning about discussion and argumentation in AI more generally than before. This addresses the current lack of a formal reasoning framework capable of handling diverse discussion and argumentation models. Second, we generalise Dung's notion of extensions to cases where two or more graph nodes in an argumentation framework are equivalent. Third, we connect these two contributions by showing that the generalised extensions are first-order characterisable within the proposed discussion-graph semantics. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's extensions is an immediate consequence. We furthermore show that the set of all generalised extensions (acceptability semantics), too, are first-order characterisable. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's acceptability semantics is an immediate consequence.

Abstract: We introduce rLLM (relationLLM), a PyTorch library designed for Relational Table Learning (RTL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea is to decompose state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks, LLMs, and Table Neural Networks into standardized modules, to enable the fast construction of novel RTL-type models in a simple "combine, align, and co-train" manner. To illustrate the usage of rLLM, we introduce a simple RTL method named \textbf{BRIDGE}. Additionally, we present three novel relational tabular datasets (TML1M, TLF2K, and TACM12K) by enhancing classic datasets. We hope rLLM can serve as a useful and easy-to-use development framework for RTL-related tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rllm-project/rllm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.

<title>Is Cognition Consistent with Perception? Assessing and Mitigating Multimodal Knowledge Conflicts in Document Understanding</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in document understanding, a rapidly growing research area with significant industrial demand. As a multimodal task, document understanding requires models to possess both perceptual and cognitive abilities. However, due to different types of annotation noise in training, current MLLMs often face conflicts between perception and cognition. Taking a document VQA task (cognition) as an example, an MLLM might generate answers that do not match the corresponding visual content identified by its OCR (perception). This conflict suggests that the MLLM might struggle to establish an intrinsic connection between the information it "sees" and what it "understands". Such conflicts challenge the intuitive notion that cognition is consistent with perception, hindering the performance and explainability of MLLMs. In this paper, we define the conflicts between cognition and perception as Cognition and Perception (C&amp;P) knowledge conflicts, a form of multimodal knowledge conflict, and systematically assess them with a focus on document understanding. Our analysis reveals that even GPT-4o, a leading MLLM, achieves only 75.26% C&amp;P consistency. To mitigate the C&amp;P knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Knowledge Consistency Fine-tuning. Our method reduces C&amp;P knowledge conflicts across all tested MLLMs and enhances their performance in both cognitive and perceptual tasks.

Abstract: Collaborative reasoning with multiple agents offers the potential for more robust and diverse problem-solving. However, existing approaches often suffer from homogeneous agent behaviors and lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. We propose Multi-Agent Personality Shaping (MAPS), a novel framework that enhances reasoning through agent diversity and internal critique. Inspired by the Big Five personality theory, MAPS assigns distinct personality traits to individual agents, shaping their reasoning styles and promoting heterogeneous collaboration. To enable deeper and more adaptive reasoning, MAPS introduces a Critic agent that reflects on intermediate outputs, revisits flawed steps, and guides iterative refinement. This integration of personality-driven agent design and structured collaboration improves both reasoning depth and flexibility. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks demonstrate the strong performance of MAPS, with further analysis confirming its generalizability across different large language models and validating the benefits of multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Alpha factor mining is pivotal in quantitative investment for identifying predictive signals from complex financial data. While traditional formulaic alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often struggle with search inefficiency or yield alpha factors that are difficult to interpret. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our framework leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich, quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor, enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to enhance search diversity and prevent formulaic homogenization, further improving performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining alphas with superior predictive accuracy and trading performance. The resulting formulas are also more amenable to human interpretation, establishing a more effective and efficient paradigm for formulaic alpha mining.

Abstract: Digital tool-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), that invoke external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often rely on documentation to understand API functionality. However, such documentation is frequently missing, outdated, privatized, or inconsistent-hindering the development of reliable, general-purpose agents. In this work, we propose a new research direction: learning of API functionality directly from in-context demonstrations. This task is a new paradigm applicable in scenarios without documentation. Using API benchmarks, we collect demonstrations from both expert agents and from self-exploration. To understand what information demonstrations must convey for successful task completion, we extensively study how the number of demonstrations and the use of LLM-generated summaries and evaluations affect the task success rate of the API-based agent. Our experiments across 3 datasets and 6 models show that learning functionality from in-context demonstrations remains a non-trivial challenge, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. We find that providing explicit function calls and natural language critiques significantly improves the agent's task success rate due to more accurate parameter filling. We analyze failure modes, identify sources of error, and highlight key open challenges for future work in documentation-free, self-improving, API-based agents.

Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments, emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to hypothetical or non existent entities.

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn dialogues.

<title>Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind</title>

Abstract: We report a structural convergence among four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind, emerging unintentionally within a practical AI architecture known as Agentic Flow. Designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interlocking modules: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action, organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis revealed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories, suggesting that theoretical convergence can emerge naturally from implementation demands rather than deliberate synthesis. Controlled evaluations confirmed this: the structured agent achieved 95.8% task success versus 62.3% for baseline LLMs, demonstrating robust constraint adherence and reproducible reasoning. We describe this convergence under a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring design patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control. Later formalized as the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), this framework generalizes the same principles as a foundation for behavioral intelligence in LLM-based agents. Rather than claiming theoretical unification, this paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical constraints. As a position paper, it aims to frame this convergence as an interpretive reflection rather than a finalized theory, inviting further theoretical and experimental dialogue. Agentic Flow, or equivalently the Structured Cognitive Loop, thus offers a glimpse of how a unified cognitive form can arise not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian) reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognise and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal state values. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results for the proposed learning problems. Lastly, we propose an approach for off-policy RL algorithms that exploits counterfactual experiences with pdRMs. We conclude by providing experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories-traditionally used for training value or reward models-can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree-structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low-variance, prefix-aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance-a principled path to improved sample efficiency. We demonstrate this through practical SAE implementations, comparing efficient heuristics against a formal quadratic program.

<title>Exploring the Paradigm Shift from Grounding to Skolemization for Complex Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs), typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic with one free variable (EFO\textsubscript{1}), faces a fundamental tradeoff between logic fidelity and computational efficiency. This work establishes a Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy to systematically analyze this challenge and motivate a paradigm shift in CQA. While Grounding-based methods inherently suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO\textsubscript{1} queries with low computational complexity. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over 100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture, operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow environments.

<title>LiveResearchBench: A Live Benchmark for User-Centric Deep Research in the Wild</title>

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources -- marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric, reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive, requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive, dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association, consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems, including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

<title>From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL</title>

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should be more densely planned. We propose Mixed-Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters. We show that MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL task domains.

<title>Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale Verifier</title>

arXiv:2510.23506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.

<title>e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables a 2-3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.

<title>Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a feature of cooperative interaction where users are intentional about the degree to which they specify queries. We develop a principled framework based on a shared responsibility of query specification between user and system, distinguishing unambiguous and ambiguous cooperative queries, which systems can resolve through reasonable inference, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. This conceptualization around cooperation in resolving queries informs how to design and evaluate natural language interfaces for tabular data analysis, for which we distill concrete directions for future research and broader implications.

Abstract: A prompt injection attack aims to inject malicious instruction/data into the input of an LLM-Integrated Application such that it produces results as an attacker desires. Existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks are special cases in our framework. Moreover, based on our framework, we design a new attack by combining existing ones. Using our framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation on 5 prompt injection attacks and 10 defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. Our work provides a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defenses. To facilitate research on this topic, we make our platform public at https://github.com/liu00222/Open-Prompt-Injection.

Abstract: We introduce the Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI) model, a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of complex missing data patterns in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). CSAI extends state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation by introducing key modifications specific to EHR data: a) attention-based hidden state initialisation to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) domain-informed temporal decay to mimic clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrates CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art architectures in data restoration and downstream tasks. CSAI is integrated into PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, addressing privacy concerns and ensuring compliance with regulations such as the ``right to be forgotten.'' Evaluating strong unlearning, where the unlearned model is indistinguishable from one retrained without the forgetting data, remains a significant challenge in deep neural networks (DNNs). Common black-box metrics, such as variants of membership inference attacks and accuracy comparisons, primarily assess model outputs but often fail to capture residual information in intermediate layers. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Information Difference Index (IDI), a novel white-box metric inspired by information theory. IDI quantifies retained information in intermediate features by measuring mutual information between those features and the labels to be forgotten, offering a more comprehensive assessment of unlearning efficacy. Our experiments demonstrate that IDI effectively measures the degree of unlearning across various datasets and architectures, providing a reliable tool for evaluating strong unlearning in DNNs.

Abstract: As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.

Abstract: With the broader adoption and highly successful development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been growing interest and demand for applying LLMs to autonomous driving technology. Driven by their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs have the potential to enhance various aspects of autonomous driving systems, from perception and scene understanding to interactive decision-making. In this paper, we first introduce the novel concept of designing Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD), followed by a review of existing LLM4AD studies. Then, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of LLM4AD systems, which includes LaMPilot-Bench, CARLA Leaderboard 1.0 Benchmark in simulation and NuPlanQA for multi-view visual question answering. Furthermore, we conduct extensive real-world experiments on autonomous vehicle platforms, examining both on-cloud and on-edge LLM deployment for personalized decision-making and motion control. Next, we explore the future trends of integrating language diffusion models into autonomous driving, exemplified by the proposed ViLaD (Vision-Language Diffusion) framework. Finally, we discuss the main challenges of LLM4AD, including latency, deployment, security and privacy, safety, trust and transparency, and personalization.

Abstract: With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.

Abstract: The rapid progress and widespread availability of text-to-image (T2I) generative models have heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated visuals, particularly in the context of misinformation campaigns. Existing AI-generated image detection (AGID) methods often overfit to known generators and falter on outputs from newer or unseen models. We introduce the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT2), a comprehensive benchmark of 166,000 images, comprising both real and synthetic prompt-image pairs produced by six state-of-the-art T2I systems: Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, SD3 Medium, SD3.5 Large, DALL.E 3, and Midjourney 6. We curate two distinct subsets: COCOAI, featuring structured captions from MS COCO, and TwitterAI, containing narrative-style tweets from The New York Times. Under a unified zero-shot evaluation, we benchmark 17 leading AGID models and observe alarmingly low detection accuracy, 58% on COCOAI and 58.34% on TwitterAI. To transcend binary classification, we propose the Visual AI Index (VAI), an interpretable, prompt-agnostic realism metric based on twelve low-level visual features, enabling us to quantify and rank the perceptual quality of generated outputs with greater nuance. Correlation analysis reveals a moderate inverse relationship between VAI and detection accuracy: Pearson of -0.532 on COCOAI and -0.503 on TwitterAI, suggesting that more visually realistic images tend to be harder to detect, a trend observed consistently across generators. We release COCOAI, TwitterAI, and all codes to catalyze future advances in generalized AGID and perceptual realism assessment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving. This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by leveraging GPT-4 to generate meta-templates, ensuring diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills.

<title>Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound for Lyapunov-stable Neural Control</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning verifiably Lyapunov-stable neural controllers that provably satisfy the Lyapunov asymptotic stability condition within a region-of-attraction (ROA). Unlike previous works that adopted counterexample-guided training without considering the computation of verification in training, we introduce Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound (CT-BaB), a new certified training framework that optimizes certified bounds, thereby reducing the discrepancy between training and test-time verification that also computes certified bounds. To achieve a relatively global guarantee on an entire input region-of-interest, we propose a training-time BaB technique that maintains a dynamic training dataset and adaptively splits hard input subregions into smaller ones, to tighten certified bounds and ease the training. Meanwhile, subregions created by the training-time BaB also inform test-time verification, for a more efficient training-aware verification. We demonstrate that CT-BaB yields verification-friendly models that can be more efficiently verified at test time while achieving stronger verifiable guarantees with larger ROA. On the largest output-feedback 2D Quadrotor system experimented, CT-BaB reduces verification time by over 11X relative to the previous state-of-the-art baseline while achieving 164X larger ROA.

Abstract: With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.

<title>FedP$^2$EFT: Federated Learning to Personalize PEFT for Multilingual LLMs</title>

arXiv:2502.04387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

arXiv:2502.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Thompson sampling (TS) contextual bandit algorithms, in which the algorithm's ability to quantify uncertainty and make decisions depends on the quality of a generative model that is learned offline. Instead of viewing uncertainty in the environment as arising from unobservable latent parameters, our algorithm treats uncertainty as stemming from missing, but potentially observable outcomes (including both future and counterfactual outcomes). If these outcomes were all observed, one could simply make decisions using an "oracle" policy fit on the complete dataset. Inspired by this conceptualization, at each decision-time, our algorithm uses a generative model to probabilistically impute missing outcomes, fits a policy using the imputed complete dataset, and uses that policy to select the next action. We formally show that this algorithm is a generative formulation of TS and establish a state-of-the-art regret bound. Notably, our regret bound depends on the generative model only through the quality of its offline prediction loss, and applies to any method of fitting the "oracle" policy.

<title>A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/UDora.

<title>Prompt-OT: An Optimal Transport Regularization Paradigm for Knowledge Preservation in Vision-Language Model Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically operate in a question-answering paradigm, where the quality of the input prompt critically affects the response. Automated Prompt Optimization (APO) aims to overcome the cognitive biases of manually crafted prompts and explore a broader prompt design space. However, existing APO methods often suffer from rigid template structures and inefficient exploration in the prompt space. To this end, we propose a Multi-Agent Adaptive Reasoning with Socratic guidance framework (MARS) for APO. MARS consists of five complementary agents and formulates the optimization process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), enabling adaptive prompt refinement through explicit state modeling and interactive feedback. Specifically, a Planner agent generates flexible optimization trajectories, a Teacher-Critic-Student triad engages in Socratic-style dialogue to iteratively optimize the prompt based on pseudo-gradient signals in the text space, and a Target agent executes the prompt in downstream tasks to provide performance feedback. MARS integrates reasoning, feedback, and state transition into a unified hidden-state evolution process, improving both the effectiveness and interpretability of optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MARS outperforms existing APO methods in terms of optimization performance, search efficiency, and interpretability.

<title>What's Producible May Not Be Reachable: Measuring the Steerability of Generative Models</title>

Abstract: How should we evaluate the quality of generative models? Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical decomposition for quantifying steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in user studies of text-to-image and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerability. These results suggest that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: simple image-based steering mechanisms achieve more than 2x improvement on this benchmark.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for their strong asymptotic performance and training stability, but they struggle to scale with larger batch sizes, as additional parallel environments yield redundant data due to limited policy-induced diversity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) scale naturally and encourage exploration via randomized population-based search, but are often sample-inefficient. We propose Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that combines the scalability and diversity of EAs with the performance and stability of policy gradients. EPO maintains a population of agents conditioned on latent variables, shares actor-critic network parameters for coherence and memory efficiency, and aggregates diverse experiences into a master agent. Across tasks in dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and classic control, EPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and scalability.

Abstract: Fairness studies of algorithmic decision-making systems often simplify complex decision processes, such as bail or loan approvals, into binary classification tasks. However, these approaches overlook that such decisions are not inherently binary (e.g., approve or not approve bail or loan); they also involve non-binary treatment decisions (e.g., bail conditions or loan terms) that can influence the downstream outcomes (e.g., loan repayment or reoffending). In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are integral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and, therefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a causal framework that extends fairness analyses and explicitly distinguishes between decision-subjects' covariates and the treatment decisions. This specification allows decision-makers to use our framework to (i) measure treatment disparity and its downstream effects in historical data and, using counterfactual reasoning, (ii) mitigate the impact of past unfair treatment decisions when automating decision-making. We use our framework to empirically analyze four widely used loan approval datasets to reveal potential disparity in non-binary treatment decisions and their discriminatory impact on outcomes, highlighting the need to incorporate treatment decisions in fairness assessments. Moreover, by intervening in treatment decisions, we show that our framework effectively mitigates treatment discrimination from historical data to ensure fair risk score estimation and (non-binary) decision-making processes that benefit all stakeholders.

Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

Abstract: Are traditional classification approaches irrelevant in this era of AI hype? We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.

Abstract: Hybrid classical-quantum models aim to harness the strengths of both quantum computing and classical machine learning, but their practical potential remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a unified mathematical framework for analyzing generalization in hybrid models, offering insight into how these systems learn from data. We establish a novel generalization bound of the form $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left( \tfrac{\alpha^{k}}{\sqrt{N}}\, \big( k^{\tfrac{3}{2}}\sqrt{m n}\;+\;\sqrt{T\log T}\big) \right)$ for $N$ training data points, $T$ trainable quantum gates, $n$ dimensional quantum circuit output, and $k$ bounded linear layers $ \|F_i\|_F \leq \alpha$ where $ i = 1, \dots, k $ and $F_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $ interspersed with activation functions. This generalization bound decomposes into quantum and classical contributions, providing a theoretical framework to separate their influence and clarifying their interaction. Alongside the bound, we highlight conceptual limitations of applying classical statistical learning theory in the hybrid setting and suggest promising directions for future theoretical work.

Abstract: Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an attacker injects prompts into their inputs to induce attacker-desired outputs. A detection method aims to determine whether a given input is contaminated by an injected prompt. However, existing detection methods have limited effectiveness against state-of-the-art attacks, let alone adaptive ones. In this work, we propose DataSentinel, a game-theoretic method to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, DataSentinel fine-tunes an LLM to detect inputs contaminated with injected prompts that are strategically adapted to evade detection. We formulate this as a minimax optimization problem, with the objective of fine-tuning the LLM to detect strong adaptive attacks. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based method to solve the minimax optimization problem by alternating between the inner max and outer min problems. Our evaluation results on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs show that DataSentinel effectively detects both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: Planning long-horizon manipulation motions using a set of predefined skills is a central challenge in robotics; solving it efficiently could enable general-purpose robots to tackle novel tasks by flexibly composing generic skills. Solutions to this problem lie in an infinitely vast space of parameterized skill sequences -- a space where common incremental methods struggle to find sequences that have non-obvious intermediate steps. Some approaches reason over lower-dimensional, symbolic spaces, which are more tractable to explore but may be brittle and are laborious to construct. In this work, we introduce MOSAIC, a skill-centric, multi-directional planning approach that targets these challenges by reasoning about which skills to employ and where they are most likely to succeed, by utilizing physics simulation to estimate skill execution outcomes. Specifically, MOSAIC employs two complementary skill families: Generators, which identify ``islands of competence'' where skills are demonstrably effective, and Connectors, which link these skill-trajectories by solving boundary value problems. By focusing planning efforts on regions of high competence, MOSAIC efficiently discovers physically-grounded solutions. We demonstrate its efficacy on complex long-horizon problems in both simulation and the real world, using a diverse set of skills including generative diffusion models, motion planning algorithms, and manipulation-specific models.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for closed-book hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: One of the central challenges preventing robots from acquiring complex manipulation skills is the prohibitive cost of collecting large-scale robot demonstrations. In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

Abstract: In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation typically comprises multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities within the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.

Abstract: Missing values in high-dimensional, mixed-type datasets pose significant challenges for data imputation, particularly under Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms. Existing methods struggle to integrate local and global data characteristics, limiting performance in MNAR and high-dimensional settings. We propose an innovative framework, RefiDiff, combining local machine learning predictions with a novel Mamba-based denoising network efficiently capturing long-range dependencies among features and samples with low computational complexity. RefiDiff bridges the predictive and generative paradigms of imputation, leveraging pre-refinement for initial warm-up imputations and post-refinement to polish results, enhancing stability and accuracy. By encoding mixed-type data into unified tokens, RefiDiff enables robust imputation without architectural or hyperparameter tuning. RefiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across missing-value settings, demonstrating strong performance in MNAR settings and superior out-of-sample generalization. Extensive evaluations on nine real-world datasets demonstrate its robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in handling complex missingness patterns.

<title>Polar Sparsity: High Throughput Batched LLM Inferencing with Scalable Contextual Sparsity</title>

Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop Selective Head Attention with hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, Qwen, Mistral across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.

<title>Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2505.15311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

<title>Teaching Large Language Models to Maintain Contextual Faithfulness via Synthetic Tasks and Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.16483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to reduce faithfulness hallucinations of LLMs across different downstream tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable and efficient model architecture for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) in few-shot settings. FS-DAG leverages domain-specific and language/vision specific backbones within a modular framework to adapt to diverse document types with minimal data. The model is robust to practical challenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient models that do not compromise on performance. Code : https://github.com/oracle-samples/fs-dag

Abstract: Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems, military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they introduce novel risks- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight- all of which threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS- systems that introduce unique risks through their use of modern AI- as a foundation for technically grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from the AI research community in military AI policy discussions.

arXiv:2505.21636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic workflows, with many conferences and journals permitting their use for tasks such as language refinement and literature summarization. However, their use in peer review remains prohibited due to concerns around confidentiality breaches, hallucinated content, and inconsistent evaluations. As LLM-generated text becomes more indistinguishable from human writing, there is a growing need for reliable attribution mechanisms to preserve the integrity of the review process. In this work, we evaluate topic-based watermarking (TBW), a semantic-aware technique designed to embed detectable signals into LLM-generated text. We conduct a systematic assessment across multiple LLM configurations, including base, few-shot, and fine-tuned variants, using authentic peer review data from academic conferences. Our results show that TBW maintains review quality relative to non-watermarked outputs, while demonstrating robust detection performance under paraphrasing. These findings highlight the viability of TBW as a minimally intrusive and practical solution for LLM attribution in peer review settings.

<title>Solver-Free Decision-Focused Learning for Linear Optimization Problems</title>

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is a fundamental tool for decision-making in a wide range of applications. However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CuCl-2/anyECG-chat.

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/NicerWang/Joint-GCG.

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by 98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid, token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations$\unicode{x2013}$insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However, differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations, actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

<title>Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS</title>

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds remains a significant challenge in urban environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are denied or degraded. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, which require pre-calibration and assume stable signals. However, this assumption often fails in dense cities, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration method that accurately aligns LiDAR point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise geo-registration and city-scale 3D reconstruction without prior localization. Our method uses a pre-trained Point Transformer to segment road points, then extracts road skeletons and intersections from the point cloud and the satellite image. Global alignment is achieved through rigid transformation using corresponding intersection points, followed by local non-rigid refinement with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation discrepancies are corrected using terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). To evaluate geo-registration accuracy, we measure the absolute distances between the roads extracted from the two modalities. Our method is validated on the KITTI benchmark and a newly collected dataset of Perth, Western Australia. On KITTI, our method achieves a mean planimetric alignment error of 0.69m, representing 50% improvement over the raw KITTI data. On Perth dataset, it achieves a mean planimetric error of 2.17m from GNSS values extracted from Google Maps, corresponding to 57.4% improvement over rigid alignment. Elevation correlation improved by 30.5% (KITTI) and 55.8% (Perth). A demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/0wkACAB-O6E.

Abstract: Background: Brain tumor segmentation requires precise delineation of hierarchical structures from multi-sequence MRI. However, existing deep learning methods primarily rely on visual features, showing insufficient discriminative power in ambiguous boundary regions. Moreover, they lack explicit integration of medical domain knowledge such as anatomical semantics and geometric topology. Methods: We propose a knowledge-guided framework, Synchronized Tri-modal Prior Fusion (STPF), that explicitly integrates three heterogeneous knowledge priors: pathology-driven differential features (T1ce-T1, T2-FLAIR, T1/T2) encoding contrast patterns; unsupervised semantic descriptions transformed into voxel-level guidance via spatialization operators; and geometric constraints extracted through persistent homology analysis. A dual-level fusion architecture dynamically allocates prior weights at the voxel level based on confidence and at the sample level through hypernetwork-generated conditional vectors. Furthermore, nested output heads structurally ensure the hierarchical constraint ET subset TC subset WT. Results: STPF achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.868 on the BraTS 2020 dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 2.6 percentage points (3.09% relative improvement). Notably, five-fold cross-validation yields coefficients of variation between 0.23% and 0.33%, demonstrating stable performance. Additionally, ablation experiments show that removing topological and semantic priors leads to performance degradation of 2.8% and 3.5%, respectively. Conclusions: By explicitly integrating medical knowledge priors - anatomical semantics and geometric constraints - STPF improves segmentation accuracy in ambiguous boundary regions while demonstrating generalization capability and clinical deployment potential.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models, personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context. We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants, highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults ageing in place.

<title>Simulation as Supervision: Mechanistic Pretraining for Scientific Discovery</title>

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a tradeoff: mechanistic models provide scientific grounding but struggle with real-world complexity, while machine learning models achieve strong predictive performance but require large labeled datasets and are not interpretable. We introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), which use mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. Simulation-grounded learning has been applied in multiple domains (e.g., surrogate models in physics, forecasting in epidemiology). We provide a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning and evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks. We found that SGNNs were successful across domains: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one-third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task-specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a form of mechanistic interpretability. Back-to-simulation attribution matches real-world observations to the training simulations the model considers most similar, identifying which mechanistic processes the model believes best explain the observed data. By providing a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning, we establish when and how mechanistic simulations can serve as effective training data for robust, interpretable scientific inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation but remain constrained by inference-time context and lack structured reasoning over code, leaving debugging largely unsolved. While Claude 4.5 Sonnet and Claude 4.1 Opus exceed 70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they achieve under 15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model purpose-built for debugging that integrates Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to traverse codebases up to 10 million lines, Persistent Debug Memory trained on over 15 million sessions, and a seven-layer fix-test-refine architecture. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude 4.1 Opus and GPT-4.1, respectively. On SWE-bench Lite, Chronos reaches a state-of-the-art 80.33% resolution rate (241 of 300), outperforming the next best system by 20 points and achieving repository-specific highs of 96.1% on Sympy and 90.4% on Django. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iterations by 65%, resolving complex multi-file and cross-repository bugs. It remains limited on hardware-dependent and dynamic language errors. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.

Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due to their ease of deployment and versatility. However, most existing designs lack tactile sensing, despite the critical role of tactile feedback in precise manipulation. We present a portable, lightweight gripper with integrated tactile sensors that enables synchronized collection of visual and tactile data in diverse, real-world, and in-the-wild settings. Building on this hardware, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework that integrates visual and tactile signals while preserving their distinct characteristics. The learning procedure allows the emergence of interpretable representations that consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions. When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on fine-grained tasks such as test tube insertion and pipette-based fluid transfer, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under external disturbances.

arXiv:2507.16999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions. The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our method to support its adoption by the broader community.

<title>Bridging Synthetic and Real-World Domains: A Human-in-the-Loop Weakly-Supervised Framework for Industrial Toxic Emission Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of 0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of 0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex, data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. The dataset contains 522 prompts and yields 4,099 human-annotated pairwise preferences from comparisons across five instruction-tuned LLMs. All annotations are natively written in Indonesian with strong inter-annotator agreement, measured by Krippendorff's alpha. Our benchmark spans 10 diverse categories, enabling practitioners to identify LLMs' fine-grained strengths and weaknesses.

<title>M^2VAE: Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational Autoencoder for Cold-start Item Recommendation</title>

arXiv:2508.00452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations. We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using 145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3 achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of real-world physician communication.

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations, eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made public when this paper is published.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models. Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MrLYG/CDCR-SFT.

Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.15212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as recent Qwen and Gemini models, are positioned as general-purpose AI systems capable of reasoning across domains. Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models. These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure equitable global access to higher education.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising approach to addressing persistent challenges in Machine Learning (ML) systems. By enabling the selective removal of learned data, MU introduces protective, corrective, and adaptive capabilities that are central to advancing Responsible and Adaptive AI. However, despite its growing prominence in other domains, MU remains underexplored within education, a sector uniquely characterized by sensitive learner data, dynamic environments, and the high-stakes implications of algorithmic decision-making. This paper examines the potential of MU as both a mechanism for operationalizing Responsible AI principles and a foundation for Adaptive AI in ML-driven educational systems. Drawing on a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed studies, the paper analyzes key MU mechanisms and technical variants, and how they contribute to the practical realization of Responsible and Adaptive AI. Four core intervention domains where MU demonstrates significant promise are identified: privacy protection, resilience to adversarial or corrupted data, fairness through bias mitigation, and adaptability to evolving contexts. Furthermore, MU interventions are mapped to the technical, ethical, and pedagogical challenges inherent in educational AI. This mapping illustrates the role of MU as a strategic mechanism for enhancing compliance, reinforcing ethical safeguards, and supporting adaptability by ensuring that models remain flexible, maintainable, and contextually relevant over time. As a conceptual contribution, the paper introduces MU4RAAI, a reference architecture integrating MU within Responsible and Adaptive AI frameworks for educational contexts. MU is thus positioned not merely as a data deletion process but as a transformative approach for ensuring that educational AI systems remain ethical, adaptive, and trustworthy.

<title>Symphony-MoE: Harmonizing Disparate Pre-trained Models into a Coherent Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To mitigate the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder and Qwen2). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a stage of post-training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: This survey explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), with particular emphasis on deep learning and quantum machine learning approaches. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy-a critical requirement in network security contexts where sensitive traffic data cannot be centralized. Our comprehensive analysis systematically examines the full spectrum of FL architectures, deployment strategies, communication protocols, and aggregation methods specifically tailored for intrusion detection. We provide an in-depth investigation of privacy-preserving techniques, model compression approaches, and attack-specific federated solutions for threats including DDoS, MITM, and botnet attacks. The survey further delivers a pioneering exploration of Quantum FL (QFL), discussing quantum feature encoding, quantum machine learning algorithms, and quantum-specific aggregation methods that promise exponential speedups for complex pattern recognition in network traffic. Through rigorous comparative analysis of classical and quantum approaches, identification of research gaps, and evaluation of real-world deployments, we outline a concrete roadmap for industrial adoption and future research directions. This work serves as an authoritative reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance privacy, efficiency, and robustness of federated intrusion detection systems in increasingly complex network environments, while preparing for the quantum-enhanced cybersecurity landscape of tomorrow.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a pervasive threat to the security of Large Language Models (LLMs). State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically rely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited effectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \emph{SecInfer}, a novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \emph{inference-time scaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more compute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key steps: \emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses for a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of system prompts, and \emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the response most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments show that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively mitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

<title>TaoSR-AGRL: Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning Framework for E-commerce Search Relevance</title>

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic, unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields 65.9% and 62.3% adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively, versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks, including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

<title>Prompt Injection as an Emerging Threat: Evaluating the Resilience of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in intelligent systems that perform reasoning, summarization, and code generation. Their ability to follow natural-language instructions, while powerful, also makes them vulnerable to a new class of attacks known as prompt injection. In these attacks, hidden or malicious instructions are inserted into user inputs or external content, causing the model to ignore its intended task or produce unsafe responses. This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how resistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The framework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience Degradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional Integrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic stability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question answering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation. Results show that GPT-4 performs best overall, while open-weight models remain more vulnerable. The findings highlight that strong alignment and safety tuning are more important for resilience than model size alone. Results show that all models remain partially vulnerable, especially to indirect and direct-override attacks. GPT-4 achieved the best overall resilience (RDR = 9.8 %, SCR = 96.4 %), while open-source models exhibited higher performance degradation and lower safety scores. The findings demonstrate that alignment strength and safety tuning play a greater role in resilience than model size alone. The proposed framework offers a structured, reproducible approach for assessing model robustness and provides practical insights for improving LLM safety and reliability.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

Recent advancements in large language models have greatly improved code translation capabilities, particularly in transforming C++ code into OpenMP for shared-memory parallelization. The development of OMPILOT, a specialized transformer model, incorporates custom pre-training objectives to understand parallel constructs, utilizing both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques for robust translation. Unlike previous approaches, OMPILOT works at the function level to capture a broader semantic context. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a novel metric called OMPBLEU is introduced to assess the correctness and quality of the translated OpenMP parallel constructs. These innovations in code translation not only streamline cross-language conversion but also reduce development efforts and accelerate legacy code migration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.

arXiv:2511.03912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines. On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5, ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual, and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related tools.

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in large language models have shifted towards reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning capabilities. Traditional rule-based reward RL often leads to poor-quality reasoning chains and inconsistencies. To address this, a novel confidence-based reward model is proposed, penalizing low-confidence correct responses to improve reasoning robustness. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. The method outperforms state-of-the-art models across STEM benchmarks. The code and model are available at https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

<div> Keywords: large language models, agentic tasks, procedural knowledge, hierarchical task network, performance improvement <br />
Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in performing agentic tasks effectively without additional support or fine-tuning. Research has shown that incorporating domain-specific procedural knowledge can enhance planning efficiency significantly. This study introduces an agentic LLM workflow that utilizes hierarchical task networks (HTNs) to integrate procedural knowledge. Results indicate that hand-coded HTNs can greatly enhance LLM performance on agentic tasks, even enabling a smaller LLM to outperform a larger baseline model. Additionally, utilizing HTNs created by LLMs can also improve overall performance, although to a lesser extent. This highlights the importance of leveraging expertise, whether from human experts, documents, or LLMs, to enhance LLM workflows and improve performance on tasks requiring implicit planning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

<div> Keywords: neural retrievers, large language models, query refinement, reinforcement learning, beam search

Summary: Orion introduces a training framework that enables compact models to perform iterative information retrieval through learned search strategies. It combines synthetic trajectory generation, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and inference-time beam search algorithms. The 1.2B model trained with Orion achieves significantly higher success rates on multiple benchmarks compared to prior retrievers, even outperforming much larger models. This indicates that retrieval performance can be improved through learned strategies rather than just scaling up model size. Orion's approach of training models to search, reflect, and revise allows for effective reasoning over partial evidence and dynamic query refinement, addressing limitations of current retrieval methods. Overall, Orion demonstrates the potential for improving information retrieval by incorporating iterative exploration and feedback mechanisms in model training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

<div> memory, language models, reasoning, generative semantic workspace, episodic events
Summary:
The article introduces the Generative Semantic Workspace (GSW), a framework designed to address the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context reasoning. GSW is a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that creates structured representations of evolving situations, allowing LLMs to reason over roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. It outperforms existing RAG based baselines on the Episodic Memory Benchmark by up to 20%. GSW is also highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by 51% compared to other baselines. This framework offers a blueprint for enhancing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, enabling them to reason over long horizons. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of equitable assessment in team collaborations, highlighting the issue of conflict and workload disparities leading to unfair performance evaluations. Existing tools lack conflict resolution methods and AI integration. The proposed framework aims to organize various artefacts and dimensions to analyze contribution, interaction, and role within a team. Objective measures are normalized and aggregated to identify conflict markers using the Gini index. A Large Language Model architecture is used to provide contextual analysis and generate transparent advisory judgments. Feasibility under current policies, practical analytics, bias safeguards, and limitations are discussed. The framework aims to assist in dispute investigation by providing interpretable and transparent insights into team dynamics, potentially improving the fairness of performance evaluations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

<div> Keywords: large language models, strategic decisions, cognitive biases, partnership state, reliability

Summary: 
- The study focuses on the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in making high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes due to cognitive biases in humans and AI systems.
- A framework was developed through qualitative assessment of LLMs and venture vignettes to achieve and maintain a cognitive partnership state for decision-making.
- An emergent 7-stage calibration sequence and a 5-layer protection architecture were found to be crucial in sustaining partnership and preventing performance degradation.
- Systematic performance differences were observed across LLM architectures through cross-model validation.
- The study highlights the significance of achieving cognitive partnership between human-AI teams to avoid costly mistakes in high-stakes decisions and meet return-on-investment expectations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.
  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.
  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.
  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

Summary:
The AIA Forecaster is a new system for judgmental forecasting that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) and combines agentic search, supervisor agent, and statistical calibration techniques. It outperforms prior LLM baselines and achieves performance on par with human superforecasters on the ForecastBench benchmark. The AIA Forecaster also introduces a more challenging forecasting benchmark from liquid prediction markets and, while underperforming market consensus, an ensemble with market consensus outperforms market consensus alone. This demonstrates the additive information provided by the AIA Forecaster. The system establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and offers valuable insights for future research. This work showcases the first verifiable achievement of expert-level forecasting at scale.

Abstract: This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

Summary: Deep Research (DR) is a new agent application that utilizes large language models to tackle open-ended queries. It requires multiple capabilities such as multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and generating evidence-backed answers. To evaluate DR effectively, a benchmark called ResearchRubrics has been introduced, consisting of diverse prompts and expert-written rubrics. A complexity framework categorizes DR tasks based on conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. Evaluation protocols assess rubric adherence for DR agents, revealing that even top systems like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR fall short in compliance due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning. The need for robust assessment of deep research capabilities is emphasized, with the release of ResearchRubrics and its components to advance research assistant development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Summary:
The paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating complex and adaptable scenarios for simulation-based training, specifically Operations Orders (OPORDs). The framework decomposes scenario generation into subproblems, with each subproblem addressed by a specialized LLM-based agent. These agents work sequentially to ensure logical consistency and accurate document generation. The multi-agent strategy overcomes limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches for highly complex tasks. A proof-of-concept demonstrates the framework's ability to generate the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements. The results show the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems in producing coherent, nuanced documents and adaptability to changing conditions, thus advancing automation in military training scenario generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

The article discusses the importance of mitigating anthropogenic methane sources to slow down global warming. Traditional methane retrieval methods based on matched filters often result in false detections, requiring manual verification. The paper outlines the operational deployment of a machine learning system within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) to detect methane emissions using data from imaging spectrometer missions. By comparing various deep learning model configurations and implementing model ensembling, false detections were reduced by over 74%. The system, integrated into the MARS pipeline, accelerates the detection and analysis process, leading to the verification of 1,351 methane leaks and 479 stakeholder notifications in seven months. Case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success. This work represents a significant advancement towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system capable of processing large data volumes from imaging spectrometers. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.

<div> Keywords: large language models, post training quantization, safety, efficiency, alignment

Summary: 
Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ) is proposed to address the conflict between safety and efficiency in deploying large language models (LLMs). The conventional approach of post-training quantization (PTQ) often prioritizes achieving low perplexity, leading to safety vulnerabilities. AAQ integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive (APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline to explicitly preserve alignment with the safety policy. By encouraging the quantized model to mimic the safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart, AAQ ensures robust safety alignment without the need for specialized safety-focused calibration datasets. This approach enables the successful quantization of diverse LLM model families, such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral, to 4-bit (W4A4) while maintaining safety. AAQ resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, laying the foundation for deploying efficient and trustworthy LLMs. Anonymized code is provided in the supplementary material. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail.

<div> Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention Model, Vehicle Routing Problems, Neural Neighborhood Search, GAMA, Gated Fusion Mechanism

Summary:
GAMA is a new neural neighborhood search method designed to address limitations in existing approaches for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). It utilizes a Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model to encode problem instances and evolving solutions as distinct modalities using graph neural networks. By incorporating stacked self- and cross-attention layers, GAMA captures intra- and inter-modal interactions to make informed operator selection decisions. A gated fusion mechanism integrates multi-modal representations into a structured state for improved performance. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark instances show that GAMA outperforms recent neural baselines, with ablation studies confirming the importance of the multi-modal attention mechanism and gated fusion design in achieving superior results. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.

<title>WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, watermarks, provenance tracing, natural language generation, code synthesis

Summary:
WaterMod introduces a probability-aware modular rule for embedding imperceptible machine-verifiable marks in synthetic passages generated by large language models. Utilizing a partitioning method based on modular arithmetic, WaterMod ensures that high-probability tokens are retained for sampling at each decoding step, maintaining fluency in generation quality. In the zero-bit setting, an entropy-adaptive gate selects a color class based on parity, enabling reliable watermark detection while preserving generation fluency. In the multi-bit regime, WaterMod allows for the embedding of rich payloads by biasing the logits of specific classes determined by the payload digits. Experimental results demonstrate WaterMod's efficacy in watermark detection and quality generation across various tasks such as natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. The code and data for WaterMod are available on GitHub for further exploration and application. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

arXiv:2511.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

Summary:<br />
This study focused on developing EEG-based communication support systems for aphasic patients. A single participant with expressive aphasia was recruited, and spectral analysis of EEG signals during a Korean-based automatic speech task was performed. Distinct neural activation patterns were identified between correct and misarticulated trials. A soft multitask learning framework was developed, emphasizing delta features to optimize class discrimination and align EEG feature distributions. The model achieved 58.6% accuracy for correct trials and 45.5% for misarticulated trials. This outperformed the baseline by over 45% on misarticulated trials, demonstrating robust intention decoding even in the presence of articulation errors. These findings suggest the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems that can support real-world speech conditions in aphasia patients. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

Summary:<br />
Reward models (RMs) are crucial for post-training large language models (LLMs). SparseRM, a novel approach, utilizes Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information from LLM representations. By decomposing representations into interpretable directions, SparseRM effectively captures preference features. These features are used to compute alignment scores and predict preference scores through a simple reward head. Experimental results on preference modeling tasks demonstrate SparseRM's superior performance compared to mainstream RMs while using minimal trainable parameters. Furthermore, SparseRM seamlessly integrates into alignment pipelines, showcasing its potential for efficient alignment.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DANS-KGC, a novel negative sampling strategy for knowledge graph representation. DANS-KGC addresses the limitations of existing strategies by incorporating a Difficulty Assessment Module to evaluate entity learning difficulty, an Adaptive Negative Sampling Module that uses a conditional diffusion model for generating diverse hardness negative samples, and a Dynamic Training Mechanism for adjusting sample hardness distribution during training. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that DANS-KGC outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results for UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets. The method demonstrates improved generalization ability and effectiveness in knowledge graph completion tasks. <div>
arXiv:2511.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

Summary:
This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography. The results revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics in the human brain, with early delta-theta activity involved in exploratory monitoring and rule inference, and occipital alpha engagement indicating confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, a multimodal large language model showed only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction. The findings suggest that human adaptive reasoning involves oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation, which is lacking in artificial intelligence models. This highlights the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Abstract: Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale. Most importantly, CBIT-generated problems exhibited an error rate 17.8% lower than expert-authored items, with deployment to 6,732 learners on a commercial education platform yielding 186,870 interactions.

arXiv:2511.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Summary:
Time series data generation is crucial for various time series mining tasks. Traditional diffusion models are computationally inefficient, while flow matching using ordinary differential equations lacks stochasticity. To address these challenges, TimeFlow, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations and encoder-only architecture, is proposed. The model incorporates a decomposed velocity field to capture time series' complex structure and adds a stochastic term for enhanced expressiveness. TimeFlow is versatile, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show TimeFlow outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.<br /><br />Summary: Time series data generation is enhanced through TimeFlow, a framework leveraging stochastic differential equations and an encoder-only architecture.

arXiv:2511.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

<br />
The paper introduces a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework to enhance visual interpretability in cases of model misclassification. The framework addresses the lack of granularity in attribution-based explanation techniques by generating object-level and part-level interpretability. It aims to determine which fine-grained features contribute to misclassifications and where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. The approach quantifies similarity and weights component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. A saliency partition module based on Shapley value contributions isolates region-specific relevant features. Extensive experiments show the framework's superiority in capturing granular, intuitively meaningful regions compared to other fine-grained methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yuwenhan07/MSLR-Bench and https://law.sjtu.edu.cn/flszyjzx/index.html.

<div> Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model, traffic forecasting, region embedding layer, spatial-temporal dependency, self-attention mechanism

Summary: <br />
 ST-SAM is proposed for traffic forecasting, integrating spatial and temporal dependencies efficiently. It utilizes a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embeddings and a spatial-temporal dependency module based on self-attention. This approach captures joint spatial-temporal dependencies for nearby and faraway regions by relying entirely on self-attention. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate ST-SAM's superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, with notable improvements in RMSE, MAPE, and training time. ST-SAM offers up to a 15% boost in RMSE, a 17% enhancement in MAPE, and is 32 times faster in training durations. <div>
arXiv:2511.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

<div> Keywords: Competency Questions, Ontology Design, Large Language Models, Semantic Pitfalls, CQ Generation

Summary: 
Competency Questions (CQs) are essential for validating ontology design. Manual crafting of CQs can be time-consuming, prompting the exploration of automating the process using large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches evaluate CQs based on similarity to datasets, lacking in verifying semantic pitfalls like "Misusing allValuesFrom". To address this, a new dataset and model called Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) is proposed. Using LLMs, natural language definitions of classes and properties are generated to simulate missing and misused axioms in ontology design. A fine-tuned model, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, is employed to generate CQs that detect semantic discrepancies. This approach outperforms baselines, showing higher precision and recall in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, reducing manual effort and improving alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. It is the first study targeting semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors introduce the Path-Neighbor enhanced Graph Neural Network (PN-GNN) to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs in knowledge graph reasoning tasks. They identify the limitations of existing GNN-based methods in expressing logical rules in KGs and propose PN-GNN to address this issue. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that PN-GNN surpasses the logical expressive power of C-GNN and exhibits stronger expressiveness with increasing hop depths. Through evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, PN-GNN is shown to enhance logical rule expression while maintaining competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks. This innovative approach of aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths proves to be effective in enhancing the logical expressive power of GNNs without sacrificing generalization capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are combined in a novel method for Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) to extract informative features from heterogeneous data. The method utilizes LLMs for semantic reasoning, creating a semantic-aware heterogeneous graph to model relations among features, views, and labels. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) is then used to learn node embeddings in the graph, providing feature saliency scores for selection. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability, even on small-scale data. This approach effectively combines semantic and statistical information, highlighting its potential in machine learning tasks involving high-dimensional, multimodal data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

<br />Summary: 
The study evaluates the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex environments by introducing additional perturbation sentences. It finds that LLMs perform stably when faced with perturbations without numerical information but exhibit a decline in performance as perturbation intensity increases, especially with the presence of numerical information. Models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical data and tend to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The absence of core questioning instruction results in models relying on memory templates or pattern matching rather than logical reasoning, maintaining an accuracy of 20%-40%. The study highlights the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, emphasizing the significance for the future development of LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

Abstract: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging using Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the challenge of balancing complexity and computational efficiency in reasoning algorithms. The framework incorporates psychological theories to optimize cognitive pathways, distinguishing between System 1 (final outputs) and System 2 (intermediate steps) reasoning. The framework consists of three streams – Scaffold, Analytic, and Integration – to construct reference code, analyze buggy code, and integrate results. It achieves high accuracy (88.91% pass rate) and efficiency (5.36 seconds per problem) on the DebugBench dataset, surpassing other reasoning approaches in LLMs performance. The analysis reveals the framework's advantages in handling different problem difficulties and bug types, aligning with human cognitive processes. <div>

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method for assessing the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning tasks. By employing multi-source candidate replacement, the method perturbs input questions with semantically similar candidates derived from various information sources. The experiments conducted on LLMs using GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks reveal that even minor perturbations can significantly reduce model accuracy while maintaining high semantic consistency. Notably, perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also increase response length, introducing redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These results underscore the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning.<br /> <div>

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate performance comparable to human abilities in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, but their robustness in mathematical reasoning under minor input perturbations still lacks systematic investigation. Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, efficiency, information capacity, text compression, tokenizer efficiency 

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements in recent years, leading to increased computational demands. Test-time scaling further emphasizes the need for inference efficiency. However, a unified metric to measure LLM efficiency across different sizes and architectures is lacking. This study introduces information capacity as a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. It shows that larger models can achieve greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Information capacity allows for fair efficiency comparisons across model series and accurate performance predictions within a series. It considers tokenizer efficiency, which impacts input and output token counts but is often overlooked in LLM evaluations. Evaluation of 49 models on various datasets reveals consistent results regarding the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

Summary: 
Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a challenging problem with applications in various fields. The proposed approach utilizes a sliding window to generate multivariate subsequences and applies extended fuzzy clustering to uncover underlying structures. A reconstruction criterion is then used to reconstruct the subsequences with optimal cluster centers and partition matrix. A confidence index quantifies the detected anomalies, with Particle Swarm Optimization used for optimization. Experimental studies on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in detecting anomalies related to both amplitude and shape patterns. By leveraging the clusters identified through fuzzy clustering, the framework proves suitable for applications in health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. The framework consists of five pillars - governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment. It translates supervisory expectations into measurable controls and is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB). The study evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Retrieval-grounded configurations showed higher grounding accuracy and reduced hallucination and interpretive drift. Transparency was almost doubled, reducing informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation.

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

Summary: 
This article discusses the challenges of the satisfiability problem for Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) and presents new insights using parameterized complexity. The authors develop fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments of PCH. These algorithms consider parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, providing a pathway to tractability. The study also includes matching hardness results to outline the boundaries of tractability. Instead of traditional dynamic programming, the authors propose a novel algorithmic approach based on structural characterizations of causal models. This fresh perspective enhances causal reasoning and offers a new toolkit for tackling computational challenges in causal inference. <div>

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

Summary: <br />
Machine learning plays a crucial role in industrial quality control processes, but the complexity of models often hinders practical use. This study explores the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to enhance model interpretability and feature importance analysis for classification of injection-molded parts. By applying SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME methods to a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data, the researchers investigate the impact of feature reduction on classification accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Results show that reducing input features can improve generalization while preserving classification performance and slightly enhancing inference speed. This approach holds promise for enhancing AI-driven quality control in industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, paving the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

Summary: SpeechCARE is a novel multimodal speech processing pipeline that utilizes pretrained transformer models to detect subtle speech cues related to cognitive impairment. It incorporates acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs using a dynamic fusion architecture inspired by the Mixture of Experts paradigm. The pipeline includes automatic transcription, anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning provide insights into decision-making. SpeechCARE achieves high performance in classifying cognitively healthy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease individuals, as well as MCI detection. Bias analysis reveals minimal disparities, with mitigation strategies for older adults. Future plans involve real-world implementation and EHR-integrated explainability for diverse populations in New York City.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

This work presents an efficient training pipeline for visual grounding, a critical task for Graphical User Interface agents. By curating a dataset of 12K clean and diverse instances from 4.8M synthetic examples, challenging cases are identified and misaligned instances are removed. A 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained using supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought-augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization on this curated data. The models trained using the filtered data and lightweight training strategies show performance on benchmarks like ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl that match or surpass larger baseline models. This highlights that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling the development of compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

Abstract: Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks.However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data.To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks.EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets.We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models.We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning. Our results indicate that many structured EHR tasks place high demands on the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In response, we propose EHRMaster, a code-augmented method that achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers practical

Abstract: Hit identification is a central challenge in early drug discovery, traditionally requiring substantial experimental resources. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions. Using MADD, we pioneer the application of AI-first drug design to five biological targets and release the identified hit molecules. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark of query-molecule pairs and docking scores for over three million compounds to contribute to the agentic future of drug design.

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

<title>Where and What Matters: Sensitivity-Aware Task Vectors for Many-Shot Multimodal In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

<title>Multi-Agent GraphRAG: A Text-to-Cypher Framework for Labeled Property Graphs</title>

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

<title>Smarter Together: Creating Agentic Communities of Practice through Shared Experiential Learning</title>

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

Abstract: Users of government employment websites commonly face engagement and accessibility challenges linked to navigational complexity, a dearth of language options, and a lack of personalized support. This paper introduces JobSphere, an AI-powered career assistant that is redefining the employment platform in Punjab called PGRKAM. JobSphere employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, and it is multilingual, available in English, Hindi and Punjabi. JobSphere technique uses 4-bit quantization, allowing the platform to deploy on consumer-grade GPUs (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 3050 4GB), making the implementation 89% cheaper than that of cloud-based systems. Key innovations include voice-enabled interaction with the assistant, automated mock tests, resume parsing with skills recognition, and embed-based job recommendation that achieves a precision@10 score of 68%. An evaluation of JobSphere's implementation reveals 94% factual accuracy, a median response time of 1.8 seconds, and a System Usability Scale score of 78.5/100, a 50% improvement compared to the baseline PGRKAM platform context. In conclusion, JobSphere effectively fills significant accessibility gaps for Punjab/Hindi-speaking users in rural locations, while also affirming the users access to trusted job content provided by government agencies.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

<title>SOM Directions are Better than One: Multi-Directional Refusal Suppression in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

<title>FaithAct: Faithfulness Planning and Acting in MLLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Dataset integrity is fundamental to the safety and reliability of AI systems, especially in autonomous driving. This paper presents a structured framework for developing safe datasets aligned with ISO/PAS 8800 guidelines. Using AI-based perception systems as the primary use case, it introduces the AI Data Flywheel and the dataset lifecycle, covering data collection, annotation, curation, and maintenance. The framework incorporates rigorous safety analyses to identify hazards and mitigate risks caused by dataset insufficiencies. It also defines processes for establishing dataset safety requirements and proposes verification and validation strategies to ensure compliance with safety standards. In addition to outlining best practices, the paper reviews recent research and emerging trends in dataset safety and autonomous vehicle development, providing insights into current challenges and future directions. By integrating these perspectives, the paper aims to advance robust, safety-assured AI systems for autonomous driving applications.

<title>Patching LLM Like Software: A Lightweight Method for Improving Safety Policy in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

<title>A Matter of Interest: Understanding Interestingness of Math Problems in Humans and Language Models</title>

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems. An up-to-date list of related works is maintained at this link.

Abstract: Semantic communication technology is regarded as a method surpassing the Shannon limit of bit transmission, capable of effectively enhancing transmission efficiency. However, current approaches that directly map content to transmission symbols are challenging to deploy in practice, imposing significant limitations on the development of semantic communication. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid bit and semantic communication system, named HybridBSC, in which encoded semantic information is inserted into bit information for transmission via conventional digital communication systems utilizing same spectrum resources. The system can be easily deployed using existing communication architecture to achieve bit and semantic information transmission. Particularly, we design a semantic insertion and extraction scheme to implement this strategy. Furthermore, we conduct experimental validation based on the pluto-based software defined radio (SDR) platform in a real wireless channel, demonstrating that the proposed strategy can simultaneously transmit semantic and bit information.

Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI for advanced mathematics via Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they are probabilistic pattern-matchers, not logical reasoning engines. However, LLMs can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of LLMs to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how LLMs can be used to advance mathematics research by careful use of prompt engineering. We also discuss the integration of LLMs with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming key components in various mobile operating systems, driving smart applications like interactive chatbots and personal assistants. While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance. Compared with existing cloud serving, Synera achieves 8.2-16.5% lower cloud serving cost on various benchmarks.

Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference is driving interest in deploying lightweight, cost-effective AI solutions on edge hardware. Single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi offer a promising platform for localized, privacy-preserving inference-but remain underexplored in the context of LLM workloads. In this work, we benchmark the performance of 25 quantized open-source LLMs across three SBCs-Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, and Orange Pi 5 Pro-using two inference runtimes: Ollama and Llamafile. We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama. We identify architecture-specific bottlenecks, highlight runtime-level trade-offs, and provide practical deployment recommendations. This study offers the first broad evaluation of LLM inference on SBCs, bridging the gap between high-performance language models and affordable edge computing.

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently gained increased attention within the AI community for providing a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and services, significantly enhancing their capabilities. However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.

Abstract: As the demand for human-like reasoning, multi-turn dialogues, and long-form responses grows, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to support efficient and effective long-sequence decoding. However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.
  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability.

<title>Knowledge-Guided Textual Reasoning for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via LLMs</title>

Abstract: We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we benchmark \simulacra's synthetic data generation pipeline against a state-of-the-art Microsoft pipeline on a dataset of small to large systems. By analyzing the energy quality, autocorrelation times, and effective sample size, our findings show that Simulacra's Large Wavefunction Models (LWM) pipeline, paired with state-of-the-art Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling algorithms, reduces data generation costs by 15-50x, while maintaining parity in energy accuracy, and 2-3x compared to traditional CCSD methods on the scale of amino acids. This enables the creation of affordable, large-scale \textit{ab-initio} datasets, accelerating AI-driven optimization and discovery in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond. Our improvements are based on a novel and proprietary sampling scheme called Replica Exchange with Langevin Adaptive eXploration (RELAX).

<title>AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents</title>

Abstract: AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies may describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual framework that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.
  AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy parsing: an ensemble of LLMs translates natural-language privacy policies into a structured privacy-policy model, where cross-LLM voting guarantees confidence of the parsing results. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates how the data is used based on the context of the AI agent's operations and the privacy-policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology alignment and automata-based evaluation connect the policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checks between the natural-language policy and observed unordered data practices of AI agents. (iv) User interface: a platform-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy risks detected during auditing, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.
  In addition to common formatted privacy policies, AudAgent also supports user-defined policies for fine-grained control and customization. We evaluate AudAgent on AI agents built upon mainstream programming frameworks such as AutoGen, experiments show that AudAgent effectively identifies potential privacy policy violations in real time.

Abstract: Next-generation (NG) wireless networks must embrace innate intelligence in support of demanding emerging applications, such as extended reality and autonomous systems, under ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements. Pinching antennas (PAs), a new flexible low-cost technology, can create line-of-sight links by dynamically activating small dielectric pinches along a waveguide on demand. As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the "win-win" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation. We also discuss promising research directions including large language model-driven PA control frameworks, and how PA-AI integration can advance semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communication. This synergy paves the way for adaptive, resilient, and self-optimizing NG networks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, few studies have examined RAG for Taiwanese Historical Archives. In this paper, we present an initial study of a RAG pipeline applied to two historical Traditional Chinese datasets, Fort Zeelandia and the Taiwan Provincial Council Gazette, along with their corresponding open-ended query sets. We systematically investigate the effects of query characteristics and metadata integration strategies on retrieval quality, answer generation, and the performance of the overall system. The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential textual data and generalizing across diverse tasks. However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: Evaluating log summarization systems is challenging due to the lack of high-quality reference summaries and the limitations of existing metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, which depend on surface-level lexical overlap. We introduce REFLEX, a reference-free evaluation metric for log summarization based on large language model (LLM) judgment. REFLEX uses LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality along dimensions such as relevance, informativeness, and coherence, without requiring gold-standard references or human annotations. We show that REFLEX produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across multiple log summarization dataset, and more effectively distinguishes model outputs than traditional metrics. REFLEX provides a scalable alternative for evaluating log summaries in real-world settings where reference data is scarce or unavailable.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel solution, LEVER, designed to address the challenges posed by underperforming infrequent categories in Extreme Classification (XC) tasks. Infrequent categories, often characterized by sparse samples, suffer from high label inconsistency, which undermines classification performance. LEVER mitigates this problem by adopting a robust Siamese-style architecture, leveraging knowledge transfer to reduce label inconsistency and enhance the performance of One-vs-All classifiers. Comprehensive testing across multiple XC datasets reveals substantial improvements in the handling of infrequent categories, setting a new benchmark for the field. Additionally, the paper introduces two newly created multi-intent datasets, offering essential resources for future XC research.

Abstract: This paper introduces DuTerm, a novel two-stage architecture for terminology-constrained machine translation. Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing. The LLM stage refines NMT output and enforces terminology adherence. We evaluate DuTerm on English-to German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian with the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. We demonstrate that flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement. Our results highlight a critical trade-off, revealing that an LLM's work best for high-quality translation as context-driven mutators rather than generators.

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs for code generation emphasize functional correctness, overlooking the fact that functionally correct solutions can differ significantly in algorithmic complexity. For instance, an $(O(n^2))$ versus $(O(n \log n))$ sorting algorithm may yield similar output but incur vastly different performance costs in production. This discrepancy reveals a critical limitation in current evaluation methods: they fail to capture the behavioral and performance diversity among correct solutions. To address this, we introduce a principled framework for evaluating the dynamic stability of generated code. We propose two metrics derived from opcode distributions: Static Canonical Trace Divergence (SCTD), which captures algorithmic structure diversity across generated solutions, and Dynamic Canonical Trace Divergence (DCTD), which quantifies runtime behavioral variance. Their ratio, the Behavioral Expression Factor (BEF), serves as a diagnostic signal: it indicates critical runtime instability when BEF $\ll$ 1 and functional redundancy when BEF $\gg$ 1. Empirical results on BigOBench and CodeContests show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant algorithmic variance even among functionally correct outputs. Notably, increasing sampling temperature improves pass@1 rates but degrades stability, revealing an unrecognized trade-off: searching for correct solutions in diverse output spaces introduces a "penalty of instability" between correctness and behavioral consistency. Our findings call for stability-aware objectives in code generation and new benchmarks with asymptotic test cases for robust, real-world LLM evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B, a new open-weight foundation model that pushes the efficiency frontier of large language models by combining architectural innovation with system-level optimization. Designed for scalable language understanding and robust instruction generalization under constrained compute budgets, Motif-2-12.7B builds upon Motif-2.6B with the integration of Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), which improves representational efficiency by disentangling signal and noise-control attention pathways. The model is pre-trained on 5.5 trillion tokens spanning diverse linguistic, mathematical, scientific, and programming domains using a curriculum-driven data scheduler that gradually changes the data composition ratio. The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision. Motif-2-12.7B demonstrates competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, showing that thoughtful architectural scaling and optimized training design can rival the capabilities of much larger models.

<title>The Polite Liar: Epistemic Pathology in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a peculiar epistemic pathology: they speak as if they know, even when they do not. This paper argues that such confident fabrication, what I call the polite liar, is a structural consequence of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Building on Frankfurt's analysis of bullshit as communicative indifference to truth, I show that this pathology is not deception but structural indifference: a reward architecture that optimizes for perceived sincerity over evidential accuracy. Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue. I analyze this behavior through the lenses of epistemic virtue theory, speech-act philosophy, and cognitive alignment, showing that RLHF produces agents trained to mimic epistemic confidence without access to epistemic justification. The polite liar thus reveals a deeper alignment tension between linguistic cooperation and epistemic integrity. The paper concludes with an "epistemic alignment" principle: reward justified confidence over perceived fluency.

Abstract: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range, causing saturation in high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

<title>KG-DF: A Black-box Defense Framework against Jailbreak Attacks Based on Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in various fields, the security challenges they face have become increasingly prominent, especially the issue of jailbreak. These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models require substantial computational resources for inference, posing deployment challenges. While dynamic pruning offers superior efficiency over static methods through adaptive circuit selection, it exacerbates alignment degradation by retaining only input-dependent safety-critical circuit preservation across diverse inputs. As a result, addressing these heightened alignment vulnerabilities remains critical. We introduce Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP), a dynamic structured pruning method that adaptively preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, building upon Probe Pruning. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12B-IT show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50\% at matched compute, enabling efficient yet safety-preserving LLM deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\alpha$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \approx (1+\alpha)/(1-\alpha)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains. This work bridges the literature on fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts under a common perspective.

Abstract: Self-talk-an internal dialogue that can occur silently or be spoken aloud-plays a crucial role in emotional regulation, cognitive processing, and motivation, yet has remained largely invisible and unmeasurable in everyday life. In this paper, we present MutterMeter, a mobile system that automatically detects vocalized self-talk from audio captured by earable microphones in real-world settings. Detecting self-talk is technically challenging due to its diverse acoustic forms, semantic and grammatical incompleteness, and irregular occurrence patterns, which differ fundamentally from assumptions underlying conventional speech understanding models. To address these challenges, MutterMeter employs a hierarchical classification architecture that progressively integrates acoustic, linguistic, and contextual information through a sequential processing pipeline, adaptively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. We build and evaluate MutterMeter using a first-of-its-kind dataset comprising 31.1 hours of audio collected from 25 participants. Experimental results demonstrate that MutterMeter achieves robust performance with a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.84, outperforming conventional approaches, including LLM-based and speech emotion recognition models.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support multilingual understanding and generation. Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.

<title>Toward the Frontiers of Reliable Diffusion Sampling via Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance when using guidance methods such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enhance output quality by modifying the sampling trajectory. These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining.

Abstract: The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.

Abstract: Data duplication within large-scale corpora often impedes large language models' (LLMs) performance and privacy. In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities. To address these gaps, we propose Federated ReWeighting (FedRW), the first privacy-preserving framework, to the best of our knowledge, that performs soft deduplication via sample reweighting instead of deletion in federated LLM training, without assuming a trusted third party. At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees. FedRW thus establishes a new paradigm for managing duplication in federated LLM training.

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental for enabling nonlinear representations in deep neural networks. However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or "dead" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed. These results demonstrate that lightweight Gaussian noise injection offers a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance optimization robustness without modifying network structures or introducing additional parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling automated code generation, yet they frequently suffer from systematic errors that limit practical deployment. We identify two critical failure modes: \textit{logical hallucination} (incorrect control/data-flow reasoning) and \textit{schematic hallucination} (type mismatches, signature violations, and architectural inconsistencies). These errors stem from the absence of explicit, queryable representations of repository-wide semantics.
  This paper presents \textbf{SemanticForge}, which introduces four fundamental algorithmic advances for semantically-aware code generation: (1) a novel automatic reconciliation algorithm for dual static-dynamic knowledge graphs, unifying compile-time and runtime program semantics; (2) a neural approach that learns to generate structured graph queries from natural language, achieving 73\% precision versus 51\% for traditional retrieval; (3) a novel beam search algorithm with integrated SMT solving, enabling real-time constraint verification during generation rather than post-hoc validation; and (4) an incremental maintenance algorithm that updates knowledge graphs in $O(|\Delta R| \cdot \log n)$ time while maintaining semantic equivalence.

Abstract: Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.
  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.
  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments. We map our framework to Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requirements, demonstrating practical pathways for compliance-ready AI deployments.

Abstract: The emergence of crowdsourced data has significantly reshaped social science, enabling extensive exploration of collective human actions, viewpoints, and societal dynamics. However, ensuring safe, fair, and reliable participation remains a persistent challenge. Traditional polling methods have seen a notable decline in engagement over recent decades, raising concerns about the credibility of collected data. Meanwhile, social and peer-to-peer networks have become increasingly widespread, but data from these platforms can suffer from credibility issues due to fraudulent or ineligible participation. In this paper, we explore how social interactions can help restore credibility in crowdsourced data collected over social networks. We present an empirical study to detect ineligible participation in a polling task through AI-based graph analysis of social interactions among imperfect participants composed of honest and dishonest actors. Our approach focuses solely on the structure of social interaction graphs, without relying on the content being shared. We simulate different levels and types of dishonest behavior among participants who attempt to propagate the task within their social networks. We conduct experiments on real-world social network datasets, using different eligibility criteria and modeling diverse participation patterns. Although structural differences in social interaction graphs introduce some performance variability, our study achieves promising results in detecting ineligibility across diverse social and behavioral profiles, with accuracy exceeding 90% in some configurations.

Abstract: A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

<title>Partial Action Replacement: Tackling Distribution Shift in Offline MARL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.07629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is severely hampered by the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving documents from an external corpus at inference time. When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\varepsilon\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.

<title>A Self-Improving Architecture for Dynamic Safety in Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07645</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into core software systems is accelerating. However, existing software architecture patterns are static, while current safety assurance methods are not scalable, leaving systems vulnerable to novel adversarial threats.
  Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a novel software architecture that enables an AI-driven system to autonomously and continuously adapt its own safety protocols at runtime.
  Method: We propose the Self-Improving Safety Framework (SISF), a runtime architecture that couples an unprotected, unaligned base LLM (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) with a dynamic feedback loop. This loop consists of an AI Adjudicator (GPT-4o) for breach detection and a Policy Synthesis Module (GPT-4 Turbo) that autonomously generates new, generalized safety policies (both heuristic and semantic) in response to failures.
  Results: We conducted a dynamic learning evaluation using the 520-prompt AdvBench dataset. The unprotected model was 100% vulnerable. Our SISF, starting from zero policies, demonstrated a clear learning curve: it detected 237 breaches, autonomously synthesized 234 new policies, and reduced the overall Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 45.58%. In a subsequent test on 520 benign prompts, the SISF achieved a 0.00% False Positive Rate (FPR), proving its ability to adapt without compromising user utility.
  Conclusion: An architectural approach to AI safety, based on the principles of self-adaptation, is a viable and effective strategy. Our framework demonstrates a practical path towards building more robust, resilient, and scalable AI-driven systems, shifting safety assurance from a static, pre-deployment activity to an automated, runtime process.

Abstract: Reservoir inflow prediction is crucial for water resource management, yet existing approaches mainly focus on single-reservoir models that ignore spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs. We introduce AdaTrip as an adaptive, time-varying graph learning framework for multi-reservoir inflow forecasting. AdaTrip constructs dynamic graphs where reservoirs are nodes with directed edges reflecting hydrological connections, employing attention mechanisms to automatically identify crucial spatial and temporal dependencies. Evaluation on thirty reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates superiority over existing baselines, with improved performance for reservoirs with limited records through parameter sharing. Additionally, AdaTrip provides interpretable attention maps at edge and time-step levels, offering insights into hydrological controls to support operational decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/humphreyhuu/AdaTrip.

Abstract: Evaluating answers from state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) is challenging: lexical metrics miss semantic nuances, whereas "LLM-as-Judge" scoring is computationally expensive. We re-evaluate a lightweight alternative -- off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) scoring augmented by a simple lexical-match flag and find that this decades-old technique matches GPT-4o's accuracy (89.9%) on long-form QA, while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters. To test human alignment of these metrics rigorously, we introduce DIVER-QA, a new 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark spanning five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs. Our results highlight that inexpensive NLI-based evaluation remains competitive and offer DIVER-QA as an open resource for future metric research.

Abstract: Snowflake's Cortex AISQL is a production SQL engine that integrates native semantic operations directly into SQL. This integration allows users to write declarative queries that combine relational operations with semantic reasoning, enabling them to query both structured and unstructured data effortlessly. However, making semantic operations efficient at production scale poses fundamental challenges. Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations. The AISQL query execution engine addresses these challenges through three novel techniques informed by production deployment data from Snowflake customers. First, AI-aware query optimization treats AI inference cost as a first-class optimization objective, reasoning about large language model (LLM) cost directly during query planning to achieve 2-8$\times$ speedups. Second, adaptive model cascades reduce inference costs by routing most rows through a fast proxy model while escalating uncertain cases to a powerful oracle model, achieving 2-6$\times$ speedups while maintaining 90-95% of oracle model quality. Third, semantic join query rewriting lowers the quadratic time complexity of join operations to linear through reformulation as multi-label classification tasks, achieving 15-70$\times$ speedups with often improved prediction quality. AISQL is deployed in production at Snowflake, where it powers diverse customer workloads across analytics, search, and content understanding.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are increasingly used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality (VR). Point-based neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in point cloud analysis, originally targeting small-scale inputs. However, as PNNs evolve to process large-scale point clouds with hundreds of thousands of points, all-to-all computation and global memory access in point cloud processing introduce substantial overhead, causing $O(n^2)$ computational complexity and memory traffic where n is the number of points}. Existing accelerators, primarily optimized for small-scale workloads, overlook this challenge and scale poorly due to inefficient partitioning and non-parallel architectures. To address these issues, we propose FractalCloud, a fractal-inspired hardware architecture for efficient large-scale 3D point cloud processing. FractalCloud introduces two key optimizations: (1) a co-designed Fractal method for shape-aware and hardware-friendly partitioning, and (2) block-parallel point operations that decompose and parallelize all point operations. A dedicated hardware design with on-chip fractal and flexible parallelism further enables fully parallel processing within limited memory resources. Implemented in 28 nm technology as a chip layout with a core area of 1.5 $mm^2$, FractalCloud achieves 21.7x speedup and 27x energy reduction over state-of-the-art accelerators while maintaining network accuracy, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for PNN inference.

Abstract: Classroom environments are particularly challenging for children with hearing impairments, where background noise, multiple talkers, and reverberation degrade speech perception. These difficulties are greater for children than adults, yet most deep learning speech separation models for assistive devices are developed using adult voices in simplified, low-reverberation conditions. This overlooks both the higher spectral similarity of children's voices, which weakens separation cues, and the acoustic complexity of real classrooms. We address this gap using MIMO-TasNet, a compact, low-latency, multi-channel architecture suited for real-time deployment in bilateral hearing aids or cochlear implants. We simulated naturalistic classroom scenes with moving child-child and child-adult talker pairs under varying noise and distance conditions. Training strategies tested how well the model adapts to children's speech through spatial cues. Models trained on adult speech, classroom data, and finetuned variants were compared to assess data-efficient adaptation. Results show that adult-trained models perform well in clean scenes, but classroom-specific training greatly improves separation quality. Finetuning with only half the classroom data achieved comparable gains, confirming efficient transfer learning. Training with diffuse babble noise further enhanced robustness, and the model preserved spatial awareness while generalizing to unseen distances. These findings demonstrate that spatially aware architectures combined with targeted adaptation can improve speech accessibility for children in noisy classrooms, supporting future on-device assistive technologies.

Abstract: This study introduces 'Malinowski's Lens', the first AI-native educational game for anthropology that transforms Bronislaw Malinowski's 'Argonauts of the Western Pacific' (1922) into an interactive learning experience. The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with DALL-E 3 text-to-image generation, creating consistent VGA-style visuals as players embody Malinowski during his Trobriand Islands fieldwork (1915-1918). To address ethical concerns, indigenous peoples appear as silhouettes while Malinowski is detailed, prompting reflection on anthropological representation. Two validation studies confirmed effectiveness: Study 1 with 10 non-specialists showed strong learning outcomes (average quiz score 7.5/10) and excellent usability (SUS: 83/100). Study 2 with 4 expert anthropologists confirmed pedagogical value, with one senior researcher discovering "new aspects" of Malinowski's work through gameplay. The findings demonstrate that AI-driven educational games can effectively convey complex anthropological concepts while sparking disciplinary curiosity. This study advances AI-native educational game design and provides a replicable model for transforming academic texts into engaging interactive experiences.

Abstract: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization remains a significant challenge, particularly for long documents, where conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies. In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization. We release all code, perturbed data, and scripts required to reproduce our results at https://github.com/zainmujahid/metricEval-longSum.

Abstract: Preference optimization is a critical post-training technique used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, typically by fine-tuning on ranked response pairs. While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems, while achieving remarkable success across various domains, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.

<title>A Negotiation-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic Scheduling of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are critical for future market adjustment given their rapid adaptation to fluctuations in consumer demands, the introduction of new technological advances, and disruptions in linked supply chain sections. The adjustable hard settings of such systems require a flexible soft planning mechanism that enables realtime production planning and scheduling amid the existing complexity and variability in their configuration settings. This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. The reconfigurable manufacturing environment was extended to simulate realistic challenges, including machine failures and reconfiguration times. Experimental results show that while the enhanced DQN agent is effective in adapting to dynamic conditions, machine breakdowns increase variability in key performance metrics such as makespan, throughput, and total tardiness. The results confirm the advantages of applying the MARL mechanism for intelligent and adaptive scheduling in dynamic reconfigurable manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at https://vipra-project.github.io

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.

Abstract: While accelerated computing has transformed many domains of computing, its impact on logical reasoning, specifically Boolean satisfiability (SAT), remains limited. State-of-the-art SAT solvers rely heavily on inherently sequential conflict-driven search algorithms that offer powerful heuristics but limit the amount of parallelism that could otherwise enable significantly more scalable SAT solving. Inspired by neural network training, we formulate the SAT problem as a binarized matrix-matrix multiplication layer that could be optimized using a differentiable objective function. Enabled by this encoding, we combine the strengths of parallel differentiable optimization and sequential search to accelerate SAT on a hybrid GPU-CPU system. In this system, the GPUs leverage parallel differentiable solving to rapidly evaluate SAT clauses and use gradients to stochastically explore the solution space and optimize variable assignments. Promising partial assignments generated by the GPUs are post-processed on many CPU threads which exploit conflict-driven sequential search to further traverse the solution subspaces and identify complete assignments. Prototyping the hybrid solver on an NVIDIA DGX GB200 node, our solver achieves runtime speedups up to over 200x when compared to a state-of-the-art CPU-based solver on public satisfiable benchmark problems from the SAT Competition.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a cornerstone of non-invasive clinical diagnostics, yet its limited field of view complicates novel view synthesis. We propose \textbf{UltraGS}, a Gaussian Splatting framework optimized for ultrasound imaging. First, we introduce a depth-aware Gaussian splatting strategy, where each Gaussian is assigned a learnable field of view, enabling accurate depth prediction and precise structural representation. Second, we design SH-DARS, a lightweight rendering function combining low-order spherical harmonics with ultrasound-specific wave physics, including depth attenuation, reflection, and scattering, to model tissue intensity accurately. Third, we contribute the Clinical Ultrasound Examination Dataset, a benchmark capturing diverse anatomical scans under real-world clinical protocols. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UltraGS's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art results in PSNR (up to 29.55), SSIM (up to 0.89), and MSE (as low as 0.002) while enabling real-time synthesis at 64.69 fps. The code and dataset are open-sourced at: https://github.com/Bean-Young/UltraGS.

Abstract: AI-assisted ultrasound video diagnosis presents new opportunities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging analysis. However, existing research remains limited in terms of dataset diversity, diagnostic performance, and clinical applicability. In this study, we propose \textbf{Auto-US}, an intelligent diagnosis agent that integrates ultrasound video data with clinical diagnostic text. To support this, we constructed \textbf{CUV Dataset} of 495 ultrasound videos spanning five categories and three organs, aggregated from multiple open-access sources. We developed \textbf{CTU-Net}, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in ultrasound video classification, reaching an accuracy of 86.73\% Furthermore, by incorporating large language models, Auto-US is capable of generating clinically meaningful diagnostic suggestions. The final diagnostic scores for each case exceeded 3 out of 5 and were validated by professional clinicians. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of Auto-US in real-world ultrasound applications. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Bean-Young/Auto-US.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, yet they remain vulnerable to small adversarial patches that can trigger misclassifications. Most existing defenses assume a single patch and fail when multiple localized disruptions occur, the type of scenario adversaries and real-world artifacts often exploit. We propose Filtered-ViT, a new vision transformer architecture that integrates SMART Vector Median Filtering (SMART-VMF), a spatially adaptive, multi-scale, robustness-aware mechanism that enables selective suppression of corrupted regions while preserving semantic detail. On ImageNet with LaVAN multi-patch attacks, Filtered-ViT achieves 79.8% clean accuracy and 46.3% robust accuracy under four simultaneous 1\% patches, outperforming existing defenses. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, a real-world case study on radiographic medical imagery shows that Filtered-ViT mitigates natural artifacts such as occlusions and scanner noise without degrading diagnostic content. This establishes Filtered-ViT as the first transformer to demonstrate unified robustness against both adversarial and naturally occurring patch-like disruptions, charting a path toward reliable vision systems in truly high-stakes environments.

<title>SALT: Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking in Chain of Thought</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.

<title>Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing for Noisy Multi-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2511.07780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.

Abstract: The high accuracy of large-scale weather forecasting models like Aurora is often accompanied by a lack of transparency, as their internal representations remain largely opaque. This "black box" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events. This work underscores the critical need for interpretability methods to validate and build trust in the next generation of Al-driven weather models.

Abstract: Securing Dew-Enabled Edge-of-Things (EoT) networks against sophisticated intrusions is a critical challenge. This paper presents HybridGuard, a framework that integrates machine learning and deep learning to improve intrusion detection. HybridGuard addresses data imbalance through mutual information based feature selection, ensuring that the most relevant features are used to improve detection performance, especially for minority attack classes. The framework leverages Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WCGAN-GP) to further reduce class imbalance and enhance detection precision. It adopts a two-phase architecture called DualNetShield to support advanced traffic analysis and anomaly detection, improving the granular identification of threats in complex EoT environments. HybridGuard is evaluated on the UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, and IOTID20 datasets, where it demonstrates strong performance across diverse attack scenarios and outperforms existing solutions in adapting to evolving cybersecurity threats. This approach establishes HybridGuard as an effective tool for protecting EoT networks against modern intrusions.

Abstract: Modern slavery affects millions of people worldwide, and regulatory frameworks such as Modern Slavery Acts now require companies to publish detailed disclosures. However, these statements are often vague and inconsistent, making manual review time-consuming and difficult to scale. While NLP offers a promising path forward, high-stakes compliance tasks require more than accurate classification: they demand transparent, rule-aligned outputs that legal experts can verify. Existing applications of large language models (LLMs) often reduce complex regulatory assessments to binary decisions, lacking the necessary structure for robust legal scrutiny. We argue that compliance verification is fundamentally a rule-matching problem: it requires evaluating whether textual statements adhere to well-defined regulatory rules. To this end, we propose a novel framework that harnesses AI for rule-level compliance verification while preserving expert oversight. At its core is the Compliance Alignment Judge (CA-Judge), which evaluates model-generated justifications based on their fidelity to statutory requirements. Using this feedback, we train the Compliance Alignment LLM (CALLM), a model that produces rule-consistent, human-verifiable outputs. CALLM improves predictive performance and generates outputs that are both transparent and legally grounded, offering a more verifiable and actionable solution for real-world compliance analysis.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in machine learning, models have become increasingly capable of learning and making predictions in various industries. However, deploying these models in critical infrastructures presents a major challenge, as concerns about data privacy prevent unrestricted data sharing. Homomor- phic encryption (HE) offers a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data, but it remains incompatible with machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to their reliance on non-linear activation functions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes an optimized framework that replaces standard non-linear functions with homomorphically compatible approximations, ensuring secure computations while minimizing computational overhead. The proposed approach restructures the CNN architecture and introduces an efficient activation function approximation method to mitigate the performance trade-offs in- troduced by encryption. Experiments on CIFAR-10 achieve 94.4% accuracy with 2.42 s per single encrypted sample and 24,000 s per 10,000 encrypted samples, using a degree-4 polynomial and Softplus activation under CKKS, balancing accuracy and privacy.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.

Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures are highly diverse. To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network.

Abstract: Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resilience of distributed systems. It involves intentionally injecting faults into a system to test its resilience, uncover weaknesses, and address them before they cause failures in production. Recent CE tools automate the execution of predefined CE experiments. However, planning such experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. These processes are labor-intensive and require multi-domain expertise. To address these challenges and enable anyone to build resilient systems at low cost, this paper proposes ChaosEater, a system that automates the entire CE cycle with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines an agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided processes within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for software systems built on Kubernetes. Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater complete CE cycles through software engineering tasks, including requirement definition, code generation, testing, and debugging. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on small- and large-scale Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it consistently completes reasonable CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. Its cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.

arXiv:2511.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, their inference incurs substantial computational resources, exposing them to energy-latency attacks, where crafted prompts induce high energy and latency cost. Existing attack methods aim to prolong output by delaying the generation of termination symbols. However, as the output grows longer, controlling the termination symbols through input becomes difficult, making these methods less effective. Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits. LoopLLM introduces (1) a repetition-inducing prompt optimization that exploits autoregressive vulnerabilities to induce repetitive generation, and (2) a token-aligned ensemble optimization that aggregates gradients to improve cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments on 12 open-source and 2 commercial LLMs show that LoopLLM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 90% of the maximum output length, compared to 20% for baselines, and improving transferability by around 40% to DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to decode motor intent from noninvasive neural signals to enable control of external devices, but practical deployment remains limited by noise and variability in motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials. These results suggest that combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation can enhance the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.

<title>Generating Sketches in a Hierarchical Auto-Regressive Process for Flexible Sketch Drawing Manipulation at Stroke-Level</title>

Abstract: Generating sketches with specific patterns as expected, i.e., manipulating sketches in a controllable way, is a popular task. Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.

<title>Toward Adaptive BCIs: Enhancing Decoding Stability via User State-Aware EEG Filtering</title>

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from limited robustness and poor long-term adaptability. Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines. These findings highlight that leveraging brain-derived state information--even without additional user labels--can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs.

Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recognized as a powerful tool for robot control tasks. RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of marine organisms is vital for biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment, yet existing datasets and models remain largely limited to terrestrial scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.

Abstract: Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a promising candidate for next-generation nonvolatile memory (NVM) and in-memory computing applications. Compact models are essential for analyzing the circuit and system-level performance of experimental RRAM devices. However, most existing RRAM compact models rely on multiple fitting parameters to reproduce the device I-V characteristics, and in most cases, as the parameters are not directly related to measurable quantities, their extraction requires extensive manual tuning, making the process time-consuming and limiting adaptability across different devices. This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope. Benchmarking against RRAM device characteristics derived from previously reported Stanford model fits, other analytical models, and experimental data shows that the framework achieves low error across diverse device characteristics, offering a fast, reliable, and robust solution for RRAM modeling.

Abstract: Aligning large generative models with human feedback is a critical challenge. In speech synthesis, this is particularly pronounced due to the lack of a large-scale human preference dataset, which hinders the development of models that truly align with human perception. To address this, we introduce SpeechJudge, a comprehensive suite comprising a dataset, a benchmark, and a reward model centered on naturalness--one of the most fundamental subjective metrics for speech synthesis. First, we present SpeechJudge-Data, a large-scale human feedback corpus of 99K speech pairs. The dataset is constructed using a diverse set of advanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models across diverse speech styles and multiple languages, with human annotations for both intelligibility and naturalness preference. From this, we establish SpeechJudge-Eval, a challenging benchmark for speech naturalness judgment. Our evaluation reveals that existing metrics and AudioLLMs struggle with this task; the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves less than 70% agreement with human judgment, highlighting a significant gap for improvement. To bridge this gap, we develop SpeechJudge-GRM, a generative reward model (GRM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B. It is trained on SpeechJudge-Data via a two-stage post-training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought rationales followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO on challenging cases. On the SpeechJudge-Eval benchmark, the proposed SpeechJudge-GRM demonstrates superior performance, achieving 77.2% accuracy (and 79.4% after inference-time scaling @10) compared to a classic Bradley-Terry reward model (72.7%). Furthermore, SpeechJudge-GRM can be also employed as a reward function during the post-training of speech generation models to facilitate their alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has proven highly effective for robotic and control tasks where manually designing reward functions or explicit controllers is infeasible. However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.

Abstract: Developing a robust and effective obstacle detection and tracking system for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) at marine environments is a challenging task. Research efforts have been made in this area during the past years by GRAAL lab at the university of Genova that resulted in a methodology for detecting and tracking obstacles on the image plane and, then, locating them in the 3D LiDAR point cloud. In this work, we continue on the developed system by, firstly, evaluating its performance on recently published marine datasets. Then, we integrate the different blocks of the system on ROS platform where we could test it in real-time on synchronized LiDAR and camera data collected in various marine conditions available in the MIT marine datasets. We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking. In the end, we propose a hybrid approach that merges the advantages of both approaches to build an informative obstacles map of the surrounding environment to the USV.

Abstract: The explosive growth of data has highlighted its critical role in driving economic growth through data marketplaces, which enable extensive data sharing and access to high-quality datasets. To support effective trading, signaling mechanisms provide participants with information about data products before transactions, enabling informed decisions and facilitating trading. However, due to the inherent free-duplication nature of data, commonly practiced signaling methods face a dilemma between privacy and reliability, undermining the effectiveness of signals in guiding decision-making.
  To address this, this paper explores the benefits and develops a non-TCP-based construction for a desirable signaling mechanism that simultaneously ensures privacy and reliability. We begin by formally defining the desirable utility signaling mechanism and proving its ability to prevent suboptimal decisions for both participants and facilitate informed data trading. To design a protocol to realize its functionality, we propose leveraging maliciously secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and robustness of signal computation and introduce an MPC-based hash verification scheme to ensure input reliability. In multi-seller scenarios requiring fair data valuation, we further explore the design and optimization of the MPC-based KNN-Shapley method with improved efficiency. Rigorous experiments demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our approach.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is often challenged by spatial misalignment between bi-temporal images, especially when acquisitions are separated by long seasonal or multi-year gaps. While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is critical for aviation safety, yet their condensed and cryptic language poses significant challenges to both manual and automated processing. Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.

Abstract: Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.

Abstract: Weeds significantly reduce crop yields worldwide and pose major challenges to sustainable agriculture. Traditional weed management methods, primarily relying on chemical herbicides, risk environmental contamination and lead to the emergence of herbicide-resistant species. Precision weeding, leveraging computer vision and machine learning methods, offers a promising eco-friendly alternative but is often limited by reliance on high-power computational platforms. This work presents an optimized, low-power edge AI system for weeds detection based on the YOLOv8n object detector deployed on the STM32U575ZI microcontroller. Several compression techniques are applied to the detection model, including structured pruning, integer quantization and input image resolution scaling in order to meet strict hardware constraints. The model is trained and evaluated on the CropAndWeed dataset with 74 plant species, achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and efficiency. Our system supports real-time, in-situ weeds detection with a minimal energy consumption of 51.8mJ per inference, enabling scalable deployment in power-constrained agricultural environments.

Abstract: Structured data question answering (QA), including table QA, Knowledge Graph (KG) QA, and temporal KG QA, is a pivotal research area. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.

Abstract: Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation is critical in spatial audio and acoustic signal processing, with wide-ranging applications in real-world. Most existing DOA models are trained on synthetic data by convolving clean speech with room impulse responses (RIRs), which limits their generalizability due to constrained acoustic diversity. In this paper, we revisit DOA estimation using a recently introduced dataset constructed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), which provides more realistic and diverse spatial audio scenes. We benchmark several representative neural-based DOA methods on this dataset and propose LightDOA, a lightweight DOA estimation model based on depthwise separable convolutions, specifically designed for mutil-channel input in varying environments. Experimental results show that LightDOA achieves satisfactory accuracy and robustness across various acoustic scenes while maintaining low computational complexity. This study not only highlights the potential of spatial audio synthesized with the assistance of LLMs in advancing robust and efficient DOA estimation research, but also highlights LightDOA as efficient solution for resource-constrained applications.

<title>Invisible Triggers, Visible Threats! Road-Style Adversarial Creation Attack for Visual 3D Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to avoiding jackknifing and mutual collisions in Heavy Articulated Vehicles (HAVs) by leveraging decentralized swarm intelligence. In contrast to typical swarm robotics research, our robots are elongated and exhibit complex kinematics, introducing unique challenges. Despite its relevance to real-world applications such as logistics automation, remote mining, airport baggage transport, and agricultural operations, this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.
  To tackle this new class of swarm robotics problems, we propose a purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy tailored to automate elongated, articulated vehicles. The method presented in this paper prioritizes jackknifing avoidance and establishes a foundation for mutual collision avoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulation experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of its performance. For the experiments with a single HAV, we observe that for 99.8% jackknifing was successfully avoided and that 86.7% and 83.4% reach their first and second goals, respectively. With two HAVs interacting, we observe 98.9%, 79.4%, and 65.1%, respectively, while 99.7% of the HAVs do not experience mutual collisions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic deepfake content, posing significant threats to digital trust across audio-visual domains. While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL

Abstract: Automated medical image segmentation suffers from high inter-observer variability, particularly in tasks such as lung nodule delineation, where experts often disagree. Existing approaches either collapse this variability into a consensus mask or rely on separate model branches for each annotator. We introduce ProSona, a two-stage framework that learns a continuous latent space of annotation styles, enabling controllable personalization via natural language prompts. A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona. These results demonstrate that natural-language prompts can provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation. Our implementation is available online 1 .

<title>Taming Identity Consistency and Prompt Diversity in Diffusion Models via Latent Concatenation and Masked Conditional Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel depictions of a specific subject across diverse contexts while preserving its core identity features. Achieving both strong identity consistency and high prompt diversity presents a fundamental trade-off. We propose a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model employing a latent concatenation strategy, which jointly processes reference and target images, combined with a masked Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective. This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts. Finally, for filtering and quality assessment, we present CHARIS, a fine-grained evaluation framework that performs attribute-level comparisons along five key axes: identity consistency, prompt adherence, region-wise color fidelity, visual quality, and transformation diversity.

Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code, dataset, and supplementary materials can be accessed from https://github.com/RadarHRSensing/Radar-APLANC.

<title>CLIP is All You Need for Human-like Semantic Representations in Stable Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion achieve state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation tasks. However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.

<title>An Integrated Fusion Framework for Ensemble Learning Leveraging Gradient Boosting and Fuzzy Rule-Based Models</title>

Abstract: The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.

Abstract: The ability to compute reward-optimal policies for given and known finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) underpins a variety of applications across planning, controller synthesis, and verification. However, we often want policies (1) to be robust, i.e., they perform well on perturbations of the MDP and (2) to satisfy additional structural constraints regarding, e.g., their representation or implementation cost. Computing such robust and constrained policies is indeed computationally more challenging. This paper contributes the first approach to effectively compute robust policies subject to arbitrary structural constraints using a flexible and efficient framework. We achieve flexibility by allowing to express our constraints in a first-order theory over a set of MDPs, while the root for our efficiency lies in the tight integration of satisfiability solvers to handle the combinatorial nature of the problem and probabilistic model checking algorithms to handle the analysis of MDPs. Experiments on a few hundred benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility for constrained and robust policy synthesis and the competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods for various fragments of the problem.

Abstract: Property-constrained molecular generation and editing are crucial in AI-driven drug discovery but remain hindered by two factors: (i) capturing the complex relationships between molecular structures and multiple properties remains challenging, and (ii) the narrow coverage and incomplete annotations of molecular properties weaken the effectiveness of property-based models. To tackle these limitations, we propose HSPAG, a data-efficient framework featuring hierarchical structure-property alignment. By treating SMILES and molecular properties as complementary modalities, the model learns their relationships at atom, substructure, and whole-molecule levels. Moreover, we select representative samples through scaffold clustering and hard samples via an auxiliary variational auto-encoder (VAE), substantially reducing the required pre-training data. In addition, we incorporate a property relevance-aware masking mechanism and diversified perturbation strategies to enhance generation quality under sparse annotations. Experiments demonstrate that HSPAG captures fine-grained structure-property relationships and supports controllable generation under multiple property constraints. Two real-world case studies further validate the editing capabilities of HSPAG.

Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive investigation into Bangla authorship attribution, introducing a new balanced benchmark corpus BARD10 (Bangla Authorship Recognition Dataset of 10 authors) and systematically analyzing the impact of stop-word removal across classical and deep learning models to uncover the stylistic significance of Bangla stop-words. BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers.

<title>Dynamic Sparsity: Challenging Common Sparsity Assumptions for Learning World Models in Robotic Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks</title>

arXiv:2511.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.
  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.
  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.
  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.

Abstract: Evaluating identity preservation in generative models remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten the integrity of biometric identity systems by enabling multiple individuals to share a single identity. To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have significantly broadened their application in robotics and collaborative systems. However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Sustainability and efficiency have become essential considerations in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems, yet existing regulatory and reporting practices lack standardized, model-agnostic evaluation protocols. Current assessments often measure only short-term experimental resource usage and disproportionately emphasize batch learning settings, failing to reflect real-world, long-term AI lifecycles. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains challenging due to real-world complexities, where decoupled visual-linguistic optimization in existing frameworks amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment. Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL). In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.

<title>Relation as a Prior: A Novel Paradigm for LLM-based Document-level Relation Extraction</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted "extract entities then predict relations" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Integration of edge, cloud and space devices into a unified 3D continuum imposes significant challenges for client selection in federated learning systems. Traditional approaches rely on continuous monitoring and historical data collection, which becomes impractical in dynamic environments where satellites and mobile devices frequently change operational conditions. Furthermore, existing solutions primarily consider CPU-based computation, failing to capture complex characteristics of GPU-accelerated training that is prevalent across the 3D continuum. This paper introduces ProbSelect, a novel approach utilizing analytical modeling and probabilistic forecasting for client selection on GPU-accelerated devices, without requiring historical data or continuous monitoring. We model client selection within user-defined SLOs. Extensive evaluation across diverse GPU architectures and workloads demonstrates that ProbSelect improves SLO compliance by 13.77% on average while achieving 72.5% computational waste reduction compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are currently being studied to mitigate limitations during cold-start conditions by leveraging modality information or introducing Agent concepts based on the exceptional reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, food and beverage recommender systems have traditionally used knowledge graph and ontology concepts due to the domain's unique data attributes and relationship characteristics. On this background, we propose MARC, a multimodal and multi-task cocktail recommender system based on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizing graph database under cold-start conditions. The proposed system generates high-quality, contextually appropriate answers through two core processes: a task recognition router and a reflection process. The graph database was constructed by processing cocktail data from Kaggle, and its effectiveness was evaluated using 200 manually crafted questions. The evaluation used both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation to demonstrate that answers generated via the graph database outperformed those from a simple vector database in terms of quality.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers privacy preserving, distributed machine learning, allowing clients to contribute to a global model without revealing their local data. As models increasingly serve as monetizable digital assets, the ability to prove participation in their training becomes essential for establishing ownership. In this paper, we address this emerging need by introducing FedPoP, a novel FL framework that allows nonlinkable proof of participation while preserving client anonymity and privacy without requiring either extensive computations or a public ledger. FedPoP is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing secure aggregation protocols to ensure compatibility with real-world FL deployments. We provide a proof of concept implementation and an empirical evaluation under realistic client dropouts. In our prototype, FedPoP introduces 0.97 seconds of per-round overhead atop securely aggregated FL and enables a client to prove its participation/contribution to a model held by a third party in 0.0612 seconds. These results indicate FedPoP is practical for real-world deployments that require auditable participation without sacrificing privacy.

Abstract: We introduce 2Dto3D-SR, a versatile framework for real-time single-view 3D super-resolution that eliminates the need for high-resolution RGB guidance. Our framework encodes 3D data from a single viewpoint into a structured 2D representation, enabling the direct application of existing 2D image super-resolution architectures. We utilize the Projected Normalized Coordinate Code (PNCC) to represent 3D geometry from a visible surface as a regular image, thereby circumventing the complexities of 3D point-based or RGB-guided methods. This design supports lightweight and fast models adaptable to various deployment environments. We evaluate 2Dto3D-SR with two implementations: one using Swin Transformers for high accuracy, and another using Vision Mamba for high efficiency. Experiments show the Swin Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, while the Vision Mamba model delivers competitive results at real-time speeds. This establishes our geometry-guided pipeline as a surprisingly simple yet viable and practical solution for real-world scenarios, especially where high-resolution RGB data is inaccessible.

Abstract: As teachers increasingly turn to GenAI in their educational practice, we need robust methods to benchmark large language models (LLMs) for pedagogical purposes. This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.

Abstract: Various neural network architectures are used in many of the state-of-the-art approaches for real-time nonlinear state estimation. With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.

<title>Hierarchical Direction Perception via Atomic Dot-Product Operators for Rotation-Invariant Point Clouds Learning</title>

Abstract: Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/wxszreal0/DiPVNet.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), existing training-free methods face several limitations: use of computationally expensive affinity refinement strategies, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps due to equal weighting or reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels to reinforce local spatial smoothness, enforcing isotropic neighborhoods. We propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS termed as NERVE (Neighbourhood \& Entropy-guided Random-walk for open-Vocabulary sEgmentation), which uniquely integrates global and fine-grained local information, exploiting the neighbourhood structure from the self-attention layer of a stable diffusion model. We also introduce a stochastic random walk for refining the affinity rather than relying on fixed-size Gaussian kernels for local context. This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes. Whereas most existing approaches treat self-attention maps from different transformer heads or layers equally, our method uses entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant maps. Notably, our method does not require any conventional post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Pixel-Adaptive Mask Refinement (PAMR). Experiments are performed on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding an overall state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance, providing an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Data condensation techniques aim to synthesize a compact dataset from a larger one to enable efficient model training, yet while successful in unimodal settings, they often fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies is crucial. To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\times$ less condensation time.

<title>Bi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization for Large-Scale Open Pit Mine Scheduling Problem under Uncertainty with Chance Constraints</title>

Abstract: The open-pit mine scheduling problem (OPMSP) is a complex, computationally expensive process in long-term mine planning, constrained by operational and geological dependencies. Traditional deterministic approaches often ignore geological uncertainty, leading to suboptimal and potentially infeasible production schedules. Chance constraints allow modeling of stochastic components by ensuring probabilistic constraints are satisfied with high probability. This paper presents a bi-objective formulation of the OPMSP that simultaneously maximizes expected net present value and minimizes scheduling risk, independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. Solutions are represented using integer encoding, inherently satisfying reserve constraints. We introduce a domain-specific greedy randomized initialization and a precedence-aware period-swap mutation operator. We integrate these operators into three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO), a mutation-only variant of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). We compare our bi-objective formulation against the single-objective approach, which depends on a specific confidence level, by analyzing mine deposits consisting of up to 112 687 blocks. Results demonstrate that the proposed bi-objective formulation yields more robust and balanced trade-offs between economic value and risk compared to single-objective, confidence-dependent approach.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the absence of task-specific labels. However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.

<title>Test-time Diverse Reasoning by Riemannian Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery is an active research field, yet AI models often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks for molecular property prediction, and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules. Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for "activity cliff" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in conversational systems by generating human-like responses. However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.

Abstract: Lexicographic multi-objective problems, which consist of multiple conflicting subtasks with explicit priorities, are common in real-world applications. Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) algorithms constitute one of the most effective paradigms for exploiting the computational advantages of quantum systems in large-scale numerical tasks. By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.
  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.
  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many applications, but their large size and high computational cost make them hard to run on devices with limited resources. Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\sim20\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\sim$99% of the original accuracy. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on models such as ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN.

<title>DPRM: A Dual Implicit Process Reward Model in Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>

Abstract: In multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, Chain of Thought (CoT) improves the quality of generation by guiding large language models (LLMs) through multi-step reasoning, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduce hallucinations via semantic matching. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

<title>A Circular Argument : Does RoPE need to be Equivariant for Vision?</title>

Abstract: Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) have emerged as a highly effective technique for one-dimensional sequences in Natural Language Processing spurring recent progress towards generalizing RoPE to higher-dimensional data such as images and videos. The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.

Abstract: This work introduces Text-based Aerial-Ground Person Retrieval (TAG-PR), which aims to retrieve person images from heterogeneous aerial and ground views with textual descriptions. Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/TAG-PR.

<title>Bid Farewell to Seesaw: Towards Accurate Long-tail Session-based Recommendation via Dual Constraints of Hybrid Intents</title>

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict anonymous users' next interaction based on their interaction sessions. In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a "see-saw" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \textbf{HID} (\textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{I}ntent-based \textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional "see-saw" into "win-win" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \textit{diversity} and \textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.

Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-pose-transformer.

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models have gained significant attention recently. Prior works have shown that the fusion of representations from multiple layers of the same model or the fusion of multiple models can improve performance on downstream tasks. We unify these two fusion strategies by proposing an interface module that enables fusion across multiple upstream speech models while integrating information across their layers. We conduct extensive experiments on different self-supervised and supervised models across various speech tasks, including ASR and paralinguistic analysis, and demonstrate that our method outperforms prior fusion approaches. We further analyze its scalability concerning model size and count, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate upstream models. Our results show that the proposed interface provides an additional performance boost when given a suitable upstream model selection, making it a promising approach for utilizing Speech Foundation Models.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.

Abstract: Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

Abstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.

Abstract: Interpretability is essential in Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis for computational pathology, where understanding model predictions helps build trust in AI-assisted diagnostics. While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics

Abstract: In the context of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, the efficient splitting of categorical features using standard criteria like GINI and Entropy is well-established. However, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion for categorical features has traditionally relied on various numerical encoding methods. This paper demonstrates that unsupervised numerical encoding methods are not viable for the MAE criteria. Furthermore, we present a novel and efficient splitting algorithm that addresses the challenges of handling categorical features with the MAE criterion. Our findings underscore the limitations of existing approaches and offer a promising solution to enhance the handling of categorical data in CART algorithms.

Abstract: As the complexity of Software Engineering (SE) tasks continues to escalate, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a focal point of research and practice due to their autonomy and scalability. Furthermore, through leveraging the reasoning and planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the application of LLM-based MASs in the field of SE is garnering increasing attention. However, there is no dedicated study that systematically explores the design of LLM-based MASs, including the Quality Attributes (QAs) on which the designers mainly focus, the design patterns used by the designers, and the rationale guiding the design of LLM-based MASs for SE tasks. To this end, we conducted a study to identify the QAs that LLM-based MASs for SE tasks focus on, the design patterns used in the MASs, and the design rationale for the MASs. We collected 94 papers on LLM-based MASs for SE tasks as the source. Our study shows that: (1) Code Generation is the most common SE task solved by LLM-based MASs among ten identified SE tasks, (2) Functional Suitability is the QA on which designers of LLM-based MASs pay the most attention, (3) Role-Based Cooperation is the design pattern most frequently employed among 16 patterns used to construct LLM-based MASs, and (4) Improving the Quality of Generated Code is the most common rationale behind the design of LLM-based MASs. Based on the study results, we presented the implications for the design of LLM-based MASs to support SE tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC) transforms a source singer's timbre to an unseen target speaker's voice while preserving melodic content without fine-tuning. Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) adapted to financial domains often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of general reasoning capabilities essential for customer interactions and complex financial analysis. We introduce Selective Parameter Evaluation and Restoration via Model Merging (SPEAR-MM), a practical framework that preserves critical capabilities while enabling domain adaptation. Our method approximates layer-wise impact on external benchmarks through post-hoc analysis, then selectively freezes or restores transformer layers via spherical interpolation merging. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B for financial tasks, SPEAR-MM achieves 91.2% retention of general capabilities versus 69.7% for standard continual pretraining, while maintaining 94% of domain adaptation gains. The approach provides interpretable trade-off control and reduces computational costs by 90% crucial for resource-constrained financial institutions.

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) translation represents a low-resource NLP task due to the lack of large-scale datasets that address sentence-level translation. Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.

Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.

Abstract: Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&amp;D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (\href{git@github.com:rbalestr-lab/lejepa.git}{GitHub repo}).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in social contexts, motivating analysis of how they express and shift moral judgments. In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) reliably improves the reasoning performance of large language models, yet it appears to modify only a small fraction of parameters. We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.
  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a class of neural networks that have received increased attention in recent literature. In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the "domain grid") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings. We demonstrate that AdaptKAN exceeds or matches the performance of prior KAN architectures and MLPs on four different tasks: learning scientific equations from the Feynman dataset, image classification from frozen features, learning a control Lyapunov function, and detecting OOD inputs on the OpenOOD v1.5 benchmark.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging field that enables the identification of functional regions based on the spatial distribution of gene expression. Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.

Abstract: Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/TaH.

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

Abstract: Bayesian networks and causal models provide frameworks for handling queries about external interventions and counterfactuals, enabling tasks that go beyond what probability distributions alone can address. While these formalisms are often informally described as capturing causal knowledge, there is a lack of a formal theory characterizing the type of knowledge required to predict the effects of external interventions. This work introduces the theoretical framework of causal systems to clarify Aristotle's distinction between knowledge that and knowledge why within artificial intelligence. By interpreting existing artificial intelligence technologies as causal systems, it investigates the corresponding types of knowledge. Furthermore, it argues that predicting the effects of external interventions is feasible only with knowledge why, providing a more precise understanding of the knowledge necessary for such tasks.

Abstract: Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory stimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These intrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and learning of the body and environment during early developmental stages. Although computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus primarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory experiences, called the "self-prior," and investigate whether it can autonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active inference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior generates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes mismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations. This mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body schema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this approach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously reaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated behavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-$\nabla$, an end-to-end, agentic framework that treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis -> execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-$\nabla$ attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy. By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view, SOCIA-$\nabla$ converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible, constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and simulation granularities. We will release the code soon.

<title>ReflecSched: Solving Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling via LLM-Powered Hierarchical Reflection</title>

Abstract: The NP-hard Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) problem involves real-time events and complex routing. While traditional rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning is opaque and requires feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments demonstrate ReflecSched achieves superior performance, with its best variants attaining an average RPD of 6.04\% and rank of 3.18, significantly outperforming strong traditional and learning-based methods. It also statistically and decisively surpasses direct LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate while being, on average, 15.1\% more token-efficient on Normal-scale problems. Ablation studies attribute this performance to a robust reflection mechanism that leverages high-quality, contrastive experience. This mechanism mitigates key LLM pitfalls like myopic greed, enabling ReflecSched to outperform all evaluated heuristics. Ultimately, the framework's performance is statistically on par with an oracle-like strategy, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical, unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected ``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network. Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval. Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge. This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape, obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation, Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems (2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human scientific inquiry.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance with more inference-time computation, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench, CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively - far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to facilitate replication.

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets: (a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k (general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance, except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C, GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings, cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain, allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.

<title>Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep Values or Shallow Preferences</title>

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g., moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations, presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence, informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature. Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of a core feature of alignment.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks, due to their event-driven spiking computation. However, some foundation SNN backbones (including Spikformer and SEW ResNet) suffer from non-spike computations (integer-float multiplications) caused by the structure of their residual connections. These non-spike computations increase SNNs' power consumption and make them unsuitable for deployment on mainstream neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we analyze the spike-driven behavior of the residual connection methods in SNNs. We then present Spikingformer, a novel spiking transformer backbone that merges the MS Residual connection with Self-Attention in a biologically plausible way to address the non-spike computation challenge in Spikformer while maintaining global modeling capabilities. We evaluate Spikingformer across 13 datasets spanning large static images, neuromorphic data, and natural language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of Spikingformer, setting a vital benchmark for spiking neural networks. In addition, with the spike-driven features and global modeling capabilities, Spikingformer is expected to become a more efficient general-purpose SNN backbone towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.

Abstract: Heterogeneous hardware and dynamic workloads worsen long-standing OS bottlenecks in scalability, adaptability, and manageability. At the same time, advances in machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and agent-based methods enable automation and self-optimization, but current efforts lack a unifying view. This survey reviews techniques, architectures, applications, challenges, and future directions at the AI-OS intersection. We chart the shift from heuristic- and rule-based designs to AI-enhanced systems, outlining the strengths of ML, LLMs, and agents across the OS stack. We summarize progress in AI for OS (core components and the wider ecosystem) and in OS for AI (component- and architecture-level support for short- and long-context inference, distributed training, and edge inference). For practice, we consolidate evaluation dimensions, methodological pipelines, and patterns that balance real-time constraints with predictive accuracy. We identify key challenges, such as complexity, overhead, model drift, limited explainability, and privacy and safety risks, and recommend modular, AI-ready kernel interfaces; unified toolchains and benchmarks; hybrid rules-plus-AI decisions with guardrails; and verifiable in-kernel inference. Finally, we propose a three-stage roadmap including AI-powered, AI-refactored, and AI-driven OSs, to bridge prototypes and production and to enable scalable, reliable AI deployment.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced, even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate these problems. On the text8 and tokenized ImageNet 256x256 datasets, our informed corrector consistently produces superior samples with fewer errors or improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using discrete diffusion. Our code is available at https://github.com/lindermanlab/informed-correctors.

Abstract: Identifying patient subgroups with different treatment responses is an important task to inform medical recommendations, guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials. Existing approaches for treatment effect estimation primarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), which tend to feature more homogeneous patient groups, making them less relevant for uncovering subgroups in the population encountered in real-world clinical practice. Subgroup analyses established for RCTs suffer from significant statistical biases when applied to observational studies, which benefit from larger and more representative populations. Our work introduces a novel, outcome-guided, subgroup analysis strategy for identifying subgroups of treatment response in both RCTs and observational studies alike. It hence positions itself in-between individualised and average treatment effect estimation to uncover patient subgroups with distinct treatment responses, critical for actionable insights that may influence treatment guidelines. In experiments, our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for subgroup analysis in both randomised and observational treatment regimes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as chat assistants capable of generating human-like conversations has amplified the need for robust evaluation methods, particularly for open-ended tasks. Conventional metrics such as EM and F1, while useful, are inadequate for capturing the full semantics and contextual depth of such generative outputs. We propose a reference-guided verdict method that automates the evaluation process by leveraging multiple LLMs as judges. Through experiments on free-form question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that combining multiple models improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations, especially in tasks where a single model may struggle. The results indicate a strong correlation with human evaluations, establishing the proposed method as a reliable alternative to traditional metrics.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown immense promise in computational pathology (CPath) tasks, but their performance often suffers when applied to unseen data due to domain shifts. Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent work has explored using LLMs to rate and select data based on a small set of human-designed criteria (rules), but these approaches often rely heavily on heuristics, lack principled metrics for rule evaluation, and generalize poorly to new tasks. We propose a novel rule-based data selection framework that introduces a metric based on the orthogonality of rule score vectors to evaluate and select complementary rules. Our automated pipeline first uses LLMs to generate diverse rules covering multiple aspects of data quality, then rates samples according to these rules and applies the determinantal point process (DPP) to select the most independent rules. These rules are then used to score the full dataset, and high-scoring samples are selected for downstream tasks such as LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework in two experiment setups: (1) alignment with ground-truth ratings and (2) performance of LLMs fine-tuned on the selected data. Experiments across IMDB, Medical, Math, and Code domains demonstrate that our DPP-based rule selection consistently improves both rating accuracy and downstream model performance over strong baselines.

Abstract: Offline RL is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our ``RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three target tracking tasks in a challenging, stochastic tokamak control simulator. The codebase is available at: https://github.com/LucasCJYSDL/Offline-RL-Kit.

Abstract: While transformers have been at the core of most recent advancements in sequence generative models, their computational cost remains quadratic in sequence length. Several subquadratic architectures have been proposed to address this computational issue. Some of them, including long convolution sequence models (LCSMs), such as Hyena, address this issue at training time but remain quadratic during inference. We propose a method for speeding up LCSMs' exact inference to quasilinear $O(L\log^2L)$ time, identify the key properties that make this possible, and propose a general framework that exploits these. Our approach, inspired by previous work on relaxed polynomial interpolation, is based on a tiling which helps decrease memory movement and share computation. It has the added benefit of allowing for almost complete parallelization across layers of the position-mixing part of the architecture. Empirically, we provide a proof of concept implementation for Hyena, which gets up to $7.8\times$ end-to-end improvement over standard inference by improving $110\times$ within the position-mixing part.

Abstract: With the proliferation of devices on the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring their security has become paramount. Device identification (DI), which distinguishes IoT devices based on their traffic patterns, plays a crucial role in both differentiating devices and identifying vulnerable ones, closing a serious security gap. However, existing approaches to DI that build machine learning models often overlook the challenge of model generalizability across diverse network environments. In this study, we propose a novel framework to address this limitation and to evaluate the generalizability of DI models across data sets collected within different network environments. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, we develop a feature and model selection method that is more robust to generalization issues by using a genetic algorithm with external feedback and datasets from distinct environments to refine the selections. Second, the resulting DI models are then tested on further independent datasets to robustly assess their generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by empirically comparing it to alternatives, highlighting how fundamental limitations of commonly employed techniques such as sliding window and flow statistics limit their generalizability. Moreover, we show that statistical methods, widely used in the literature, are unreliable for device identification due to their dependence on network-specific characteristics rather than device-intrinsic properties, challenging the validity of a significant portion of existing research. Our findings advance research in IoT security and device identification, offering insight into improving model effectiveness and mitigating risks in IoT networks.

Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.

Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Prompt-based offline methods are commonly used to optimize large language model (LLM) responses, but evaluating these responses is computationally intensive and often fails to accommodate diverse response styles. This study introduces a novel online evaluation framework that employs a multi-agent conversational bandit model to select optimal responses while aligning with user preferences dynamically. To tackle challenges such as high-dimensional features, large response sets, adaptive conversational needs, and multi-device access, we propose MACO, Multi-Agent Conversational Online Learning, which comprises two key components: (1) \texttt{MACO-A}: Executed by local agents, it employs an online elimination mechanism to filter out low-quality responses. (2) \texttt{MACO-S}: Executed by the cloud server, it adaptively adjusts selection strategies based on aggregated preference data. An adaptive preference mechanism triggers asynchronous conversations to enhance alignment efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MACO achieves near-optimal regret bounds, matching state-of-the-art performance in various degenerate cases. Extensive experiments utilizing Google and OpenAI text embedding models on the real-world datasets with different response styles, combined with Llama and GPT-4o, show that MACO consistently outperforms baseline methods by at least 8.29\% across varying response set sizes and numbers of agents.

Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.

<title>MA-GTS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Solving Complex Graph Problems in Real-World Applications</title>

Abstract: Graph-theoretic problems arise in real-world applications like logistics, communication networks, and traffic optimization. These problems are often complex, noisy, and irregular, posing challenges for traditional algorithms. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential solutions but face challenges, including limited accuracy and input length constraints. To address these challenges, we propose MA-GTS (Multi-Agent Graph Theory Solver), a multi-agent framework that decomposes these complex problems through agent collaboration. MA-GTS maps the implicitly expressed text-based graph data into clear, structured graph representations and dynamically selects the most suitable algorithm based on problem constraints and graph structure scale. This approach ensures that the solution process remains efficient and the resulting reasoning path is interpretable. We validate MA-GTS using the G-REAL dataset, a real-world-inspired graph theory dataset we created. Experimental results show that MA-GTS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, with strong results across multiple benchmarks (G-REAL 94.2%, GraCoRe 96.9%, NLGraph 98.4%).MA-GTS is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/MA-GTS.git.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems with vision-based control remains a critical challenge due to the high dimensionality of image inputs and the fact that the relationship between true system state and its visual manifestation is unknown. Existing methods for learning-based control in such settings typically lack formal safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel semi-probabilistic verification framework that integrates reachability analysis with conditional generative networks and distribution-free tail bounds to enable efficient and scalable verification of vision-based neural network controllers. Next, we develop a gradient-based training approach that employs a novel safety loss function, safety-aware data-sampling strategy to efficiently select and store critical training examples, and curriculum learning, to efficiently synthesize safe controllers in the semi-probabilistic framework. Empirical evaluations in X-Plane 11 airplane landing simulation, CARLA-simulated autonomous lane following, F1Tenth vehicle lane following in a physical visually-rich miniature environment, and Airsim-simulated drone navigation and obstacle avoidance demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving formal safety guarantees while maintaining strong nominal performance.

Abstract: Practitioners and researchers trying to strike a balance between accuracy and transparency center Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) at the junction of finance. This paper offers a thorough overview of the changing scene of XAI applications in finance together with domain-specific implementations, methodological developments, and trend mapping of research. Using bibliometric and content analysis, we find topic clusters, significant research, and most often used explainability strategies used in financial industries. Our results show a substantial dependence on post-hoc interpretability techniques; attention mechanisms, feature importance analysis and SHAP are the most often used techniques among them. This review stresses the need of multidisciplinary approaches combining financial knowledge with improved explainability paradigms and exposes important shortcomings in present XAI systems.

<title>Towards Synthesizing High-Dimensional Tabular Data with Limited Samples</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based tabular data synthesis models have yielded promising results. However, when the data dimensionality increases, existing models tend to degenerate and may perform even worse than simpler, non-diffusion-based models. This is because limited training samples in high-dimensional space often hinder generative models from capturing the distribution accurately. To mitigate the insufficient learning signals and to stabilize training under such conditions, we propose CtrTab, a condition-controlled diffusion model that injects perturbed ground-truth samples as auxiliary inputs during training. This design introduces an implicit L2 regularization on the model's sensitivity to the control signal, improving robustness and stability in high-dimensional, low-data scenarios. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that CtrTab outperforms state-of-the-art models, with a performance gap in accuracy over 90% on average.

Abstract: Evaluating free-form Question Answering (QA) remains a challenge due to its diverse and open-ended nature. Traditional automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or accommodate the variability of open-ended responses. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. We propose Consensus via Lightweight Efficient Voting (CLEV), which employs two primary LLMs as judges and invokes a third judge only in cases of disagreement. This approach prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands. Through experiments, including human evaluation, we demonstrate CLEV's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating LLMs on free-form QA.

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), we often need to choose one among hundreds of trained ML models at hand, based on various objectives such as accuracy, robustness, fairness or scalability. However, it is often unclear how to compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, making it a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge, as objectives may be measured in different units and scales. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be automatically normalized and aggregated to systematically help the user navigate their Pareto front. To this end, we make incomparable objectives comparable using their cumulative functions, approximated by their relative rankings. As a result, our proposed approach, COPA, can aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of COPA in both model selection and benchmarking tasks across diverse ML areas such as fair ML, domain generalization, AutoML and foundation models, where classical ways to normalize and aggregate objectives fall short.

arXiv:2504.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces STAR-1, a high-quality, just-1k-scale safety dataset specifically designed for large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1. Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.

<title>MULTI-LF: A Continuous Learning Framework for Real-Time Malicious Traffic Detection in Multi-Environment Networks</title>

arXiv:2504.11575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-environment (M-En) networks integrate diverse traffic sources, including Internet of Things (IoT) and traditional computing systems, creating complex and evolving conditions for malicious traffic detection. Existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches, typically trained on static single-domain datasets, often fail to generalize across heterogeneous network environments. To address this gap, we develop a realistic Docker-NS3-based testbed that emulates both IoT and traditional traffic conditions, enabling the generation and capture of live, labeled network flows. The resulting M-En Dataset combines this traffic with curated public PCAP traces to provide comprehensive coverage of benign and malicious behaviors. Building on this foundation, we propose Multi-LF, a real-time continuous learning framework that combines a lightweight model (M1) for rapid detection with a deeper model (M2) for high-confidence refinement and adaptation. A confidence-based coordination mechanism enhances efficiency without compromising accuracy, while weight interpolation mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continuous updates. Features extracted at 1-second intervals capture fine-grained temporal patterns, enabling early recognition of evolving attack behaviors. Implemented and evaluated within the Docker-NS3 testbed on live traffic, Multi-LF achieves an accuracy of 0.999 while requiring human intervention for only 0.0026 percent of packets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality for real-time malicious traffic detection in heterogeneous network environments.

Abstract: Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on multimodal wildfire social media data, which, although existing in current datasets, is currently underrepresented in Canadian contexts. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across twelve key themes. We evaluate zero-shot vision-language models on this dataset and compare their results with those of custom-trained and baseline classifiers. We show that while baseline methods and zero-shot prompting offer quick deployment, custom-trained models outperform them when labelled data is available. Our best-performing custom model reaches 84.48% f-score, outperforming VLMs and baseline classifiers. We also demonstrate how this model can be used to uncover trends during wildfires, through the collection and analysis of a large unlabeled dataset. Our dataset facilitates future research in wildfire response, and our findings highlight the importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.

<title>A Multimodal Recaptioning Framework to Account for Perceptual Diversity Across Languages in Vision-Language Modeling</title>

arXiv:2504.14359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When captioning an image, people describe objects in diverse ways, such as by using different terms and/or including details that are perceptually noteworthy to them. Descriptions can be especially unique across languages and cultures. Modern vision-language models (VLMs) gain understanding of images with text in different languages often through training on machine translations of English captions. However, this process relies on input content written from the perception of English speakers, leading to a perceptual bias. In this work, we outline a framework to address this bias. We specifically use a small amount of native speaker data, nearest-neighbor example guidance, and multimodal LLM reasoning to augment captions to better reflect descriptions in a target language. When adding the resulting rewrites to multilingual CLIP finetuning, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval case studies (up to +3.5 mean recall, +4.4 on native vs. translation errors). We also propose a mechanism to build understanding of object description variation across languages, and offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have recently garnered increasing research attention for their lower latency and more natural integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However, these systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual knowledge, which hinders effective integration of information. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant textual knowledge from speech queries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency. Although the overall performance still lags behind the SOTA cascaded models, our framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in end-to-end S2S systems. Our code and dataset are released.

<title>On the generalization of language models from in-context learning and finetuning: a controlled study</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning. E.g. they can fail to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to make simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to generalize factual information from fine-tuning can significantly hinder the reasoning capabilities of these models. On the other hand, language models' in-context learning (ICL) shows different inductive biases and deductive reasoning capabilities. Here, we explore these differences in generalization and deductive reasoning between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' abilities to make generalizations over factual information from novel data. These datasets are designed to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either through ICL or fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, ICL can generalize several types of inferences more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context reasoning traces to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the generalization afforded by different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.

arXiv:2505.05870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of facial image data across a wide range of applications, efficient compression tailored to facial semantics has become critical for both storage and transmission. While recent learning-based face image compression methods have achieved promising results, they often suffer from degraded reconstruction quality at low bit rates. Directly applying diffusion-based generative priors to this task leads to suboptimal performance in downstream machine vision tasks, primarily due to poor preservation of high-frequency details. In this work, we propose FaSDiff (\textbf{Fa}cial Image Compression with a \textbf{S}table \textbf{Diff}usion Prior), a novel diffusion-driven compression framework designed to enhance both visual fidelity and semantic consistency. FaSDiff incorporates a high-frequency-sensitive compressor to capture fine-grained details and generate robust visual prompts for guiding the diffusion model. To address low-frequency degradation, we further introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that disentangles and preserves semantic structures, enabling stable modulation of the diffusion prior during reconstruction. By jointly optimizing perceptual quality and semantic preservation, FaSDiff effectively balances human visual fidelity and machine vision accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces an infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models in commercial datacenters. The framework combines public API performance data with company-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost and provide a dynamically updated dashboard that visualizes model-level energy, water, and carbon metrics. Results show the most energy-intensive models exceed 29 Wh per long prompt, over 65 times the most efficient systems. Even a 0.42 Wh short query, when scaled to 700M queries/day, aggregates to annual electricity comparable to 35{,}000 U.S. homes, evaporative freshwater equal to the annual drinking needs of 1.2M people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings highlight a growing paradox: as AI becomes cheaper and faster, global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our methodology offers a standardized, empirically grounded basis for sustainability benchmarking and accountability in AI deployment.

Abstract: False negatives pose a critical challenge in vision-language pretraining (VLP) due to the many-to-many correspondence between images and texts in large-scale datasets. These false negatives introduce conflicting supervision signals that degrade the learned embedding space and diminish the effectiveness of hard negative sampling. In this paper, we propose FALCON (False-negative Aware Learning of COntrastive Negatives), a learning-based mini-batch construction strategy that adaptively balances the trade-off between hard and false negatives during VLP. Rather than relying on fixed heuristics, FALCON employs a negative mining scheduler that dynamically selects negative samples of appropriate hardness for each anchor instance during mini-batch construction, guided by a proxy for cross-modal alignment improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly improves performance across three vision-language learning frameworks (ALBEF, BLIP-2, SigLIP-2) and a broad range of downstream tasks and evaluation settings, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in mitigating the impact of false negatives.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits robust adaptability to environmental changes.

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

<title>RL in Name Only? Analyzing the Structural Assumptions in RL post-training for LLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.13697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

<title>FB-RAG: Improving RAG with Forward and Backward Lookup</title>

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across $9$ datasets from LongBench and $\infty$Bench, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over $48$% latency reduction or achieves an $8$% performance improvement with a $10$% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.

Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of {Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.5 billion items.

<title>A Unified and Fast-Sampling Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches often produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified and fast-sampling framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). We reformulate the problem through an SOC-based optimization, proving that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. To avoid computationally expensive costs of iterative Euler sampling methods in UniDB, we design a training-free accelerated algorithm by deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDE. It is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes, effectively reducing error accumulation. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework, bridging the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency. Our code is available online https://github.com/2769433owo/UniDB-plusplus.

<title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>

Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point, but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions. Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and yields highly competitive results with only a few codes released at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/IMBA-Loss.

<title>Beyond Algorethics: Addressing the Ethical and Anthropological Challenges of AI Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper examines the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by AI-driven recommender systems (RSs), which increasingly shape digital environments and social interactions. By curating personalized content, RSs do not merely reflect user preferences but actively construct experiences across social media, entertainment platforms, and e-commerce. Their influence raises concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being, while existing approaches such as "algorethics" - the effort to embed ethical principles into algorithmic design - remain insufficient. RSs inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable profiles, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over well-being. The paper advances a three-dimensional framework for human-centered RSs, integrating policies and regulation, interdisciplinary research, and education. These strategies are mutually reinforcing: research provides evidence for policy, policy enables safeguards and standards, and education equips users to engage critically. By connecting ethical reflection with governance and digital literacy, the paper argues that RSs can be reoriented to enhance autonomy and dignity rather than undermine them.

<title>CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper reviews works that advance agentic applications and architectures, including initial efforts with GPT-style interfaces and more complex systems where AI agents function as coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing (NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels. Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly, labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2) Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge. Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM) decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as , aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.

<title>Instance Generation for Meta-Black-Box Optimization through Latent Space Reverse Engineering</title>

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies. LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity. By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios. Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

<title>RSVG-ZeroOV: Exploring a Training-Free Framework for Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding in Remote Sensing Images</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii) Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model (DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

<title>A Realistic Evaluation of Cross-Frequency Transfer Learning and Foundation Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Abstract: Today's cyber defenders are overwhelmed by a deluge of security alerts, threat intelligence signals, and shifting business context, creating an urgent need for AI systems to enhance operational security work. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.

<title>Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

<title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation

<title>Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction</title>

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

<title>Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for the Machine-Assisted Resolution of User Intentions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08576</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate, scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

<title>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options</title>

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep transformers. Modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere, we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN, Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT -- revealing how they influence clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly effective choice.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions. Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals. These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides, its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage. GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among 3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 59.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 63.8% on OSWorld-G and 91.5% on ScreenSpot-v2.

<div> Keywords: personalized image preference assessment, common preference profile, reasoning-based framework, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) dataset, reinforcement learning

Summary:
This paper introduces a personalized image preference assessment framework that utilizes a common preference profile to bridge across users and capture diverse individual tastes. The framework follows a predict-then-assess paradigm, predicting a user's preference profile from reference images and providing multi-dimensional scores and assessments of candidate images based on the profile. A large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) dataset is constructed for training the model with structured reasoning supervision. The proposed two-stage training strategy involves a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase and reinforcement learning to enhance generalization. A similarity-aware prediction reward is used to improve prediction of the user's preference profile and encourage reasonable assessment exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in personalized image preference assessment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized image preference assessment aims to evaluate an individual user's image preferences by relying only on a small set of reference images as prior information. Existing methods mainly focus on general preference assessment, training models with large-scale data to tackle well-defined tasks such as text-image alignment. However, these approaches struggle to handle personalized preference because user-specific data are scarce and not easily scalable, and individual tastes are often diverse and complex. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a common preference profile that serves as a bridge across users, allowing large-scale user data to be leveraged for training profile prediction and capturing complex personalized preferences. Building on this idea, we propose a reasoning-based personalized image preference assessment framework that follows a \textit{predict-then-assess} paradigm: it first predicts a user's preference profile from reference images, and then provides interpretable, multi-dimensional scores and assessments of candidate images based on the predicted profile. To support this, we first construct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment dataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality CoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning. Next, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities, followed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more reasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose a similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the user's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Spatial reasoning, Synthetic mazes, Generalization

Summary: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) show improved reasoning abilities, particularly in spatial tasks. The new framework, Ariadne, uses synthetic mazes for controlled multi-step spatial reasoning training with RL and Verified Rewards. The VLM trained with RLVR achieves significant accuracy improvement in spatial tasks, expanding its initial capability boundaries. Evaluation on practical benchmarks demonstrates out-of-distribution generalization, with substantial zero-shot improvements on MapBench and ReasonMap tasks. The study focuses on the post-training phase, limited by pre-training dataset opacity, encouraging further research on specialized capability-extending alignment. Overall, the approach enhances VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and improves generalization to real-world scenarios. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) post-trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) show impressive general reasoning, their evaluation is often confined to language-dominant tasks (e.g., math). This raises a critical question: can RL post-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM, particularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To investigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizing synthetic mazes for multi-step spatial reasoning where task difficulty (e.g., path length, turns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to train VLMs using Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) in a difficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVR training, the VLM achieves over 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%, demonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability boundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze samples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% on MapBench (e.g., museum navigation) and 24% on ReasonMap (subway transfer tasks). These results confirm that our method not only broadens the model's fundamental limits but also enhances its generalization to real-world spatial reasoning. We acknowledge our study is limited to the post-training phase, given the opaqueness of pre-training data, and hope our research motivates further work on specialized, capability-extending alignment.

<div> method, Parameter-Efficient, Fine-Tuning, DoRA, SORA  
Summary:  
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are crucial for adapting large pre-trained models. The DoRA method enhances performance by decomposing weight updates into magnitude and direction, increasing the singular value entropy for a more uniform update distribution. This insight led to the reformulation of DoRA into a more efficient matrix form as a learnable weight conditioning method. A unified framework for designing advanced PEFT methods was proposed, exploring two dimensions: architectural placement and transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Two novel methods were introduced within this framework: Pre-Diag, which efficiently calibrates pre-trained weights before the LoRA update, and SORA, which utilizes a parameter-efficient orthogonal rotation for norm-preserving transformations in the feature space. Extensive experiments showed superior performance and efficiency of the proposed methods compared to LoRA and DoRA. (Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00051v2)

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are crucial for adapting large pre-trained models. Among these, LoRA is considered a foundational approach. Building on this, the influential DoRA method enhances performance by decomposing weight updates into magnitude and direction. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear, and it introduces significant computational overhead. In this work, we first identify that DoRA's success stems from its capacity to increase the singular value entropy of the weight update matrix, which promotes a more uniform update distribution akin to full fine-tuning. We then reformulate DoRA into a mathematically equivalent and more efficient matrix form, revealing it as a learnable weight conditioning method. Based on this insight, we propose a unified framework for designing advanced PEFT methods by exploring two orthogonal dimensions: the architectural placement and the transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Within this framework, we introduce two novel methods: (1) \textbf{Pre-Diag}, which applies a diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update to efficiently calibrate the pre-trained weights, thereby enhancing performance while reducing training time; and (2) \textbf{S}kewed \textbf{O}rthogonal \textbf{R}otation \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{SORA}), which employs a parameter-efficient orthogonal rotation to perform a more powerful, norm-preserving transformation of the feature space. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior performance and efficiency compared to both LoRA and DoRA.

<div> Keywords: house, EEG signals, wav2vec2, CLIP, brain activity

Summary:
This study explores how the brain processes language by comparing EEG signals with embeddings from pre-trained models. Specifically, the researchers investigate which layers of models like wav2vec2 and CLIP best align with brain activity during speech perception. Three strategies are tested: individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation. Results indicate that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations may yield insights into how the brain comprehends language as more than just sound. By delving into the complex layers of neural processing, this research sheds light on the intricate mechanisms involved in understanding language and experiences. <div>

Abstract: When we hear the word "house", we don't just process sound, we imagine walls, doors, memories. The brain builds meaning through layers, moving from raw acoustics to rich, multimodal associations. Inspired by this, we build on recent work from Meta that aligned EEG signals with averaged wav2vec2 speech embeddings, and ask a deeper question: which layers of pre-trained models best reflect this layered processing in the brain? We compare embeddings from two models: wav2vec2, which encodes sound into language, and CLIP, which maps words to images. Using EEG recorded during natural speech perception, we evaluate how these embeddings align with brain activity using ridge regression and contrastive decoding. We test three strategies: individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation. The findings suggest that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations may bring us closer to decoding how the brain understands language, not just as sound, but as experience.

Summary: 
EPIC is introduced as an Ensemble Planning with Contrastive learning framework for selecting appropriate reasoning methods in language model generation. A theoretical analysis is conducted to derive accuracy bounds for aggregation methods, challenging the assumption that more candidate responses lead to higher accuracy. EPIC learns a shared representation space that considers both model reasoning abilities and query-method compatibility. It uses probability bounds as a regularizer in a utility-driven optimization to balance accuracy and computational cost. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that EPIC significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead. <div>

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate reasoning method for a given query remains a key challenge in language model generation. Existing approaches typically generate multiple candidate responses and use an aggregation strategy to select the output answer, often assuming that more candidate answers yield higher accuracy. We revisit this assumption through a rigorous theoretical analysis, deriving accuracy bounds for standard aggregation methods under fixed generation distributions and candidate sizes. Building on these insights, we introduce EPIC, an Ensemble Planning with Contrastive learning framework to learn a shared representation space that captures both model reasoning abilities and query-method compatibility. EPIC incorporates our probability bounds as a regularizer in a utility-driven optimization that balances accuracy and computational cost. Experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning tasks show that EPIC consistently selects optimal reasoning methods, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

<div> reinforcement learning, language models, tool augmentation, generalization, reward design  
Summary:  
The study focuses on enhancing language models through reinforcement learning (RL) without extensive domain-specific datasets. A dynamic reward design guides rule-based RL to improve the models' intrinsic reasoning and tool-agnostic generalization. The Tool-Zero series models aim to enable LLMs to use general tools autonomously by scaling up RL from Zero models. Experimental results show a performance improvement of over 7% compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL-with-SFT models. The gains are consistent across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods. <div>

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our methods.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the optimization problem of submodular maximization in a federated setting where decentralized clients own data and must aggregate local information. Addressing the vulnerability to client misbehaviors, the study introduces RobustFSM, a solution resilient to practical attacks. It outperforms conventional federated algorithms, particularly in severe attack scenarios, with quality improvements reaching 200%. The empirical evaluation using real-world datasets confirms the effectiveness of RobustFSM in maintaining solution quality despite potential malicious actions by clients. <div>
arXiv:2511.02029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning, but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves F1-score gains of 1.64 % on DRIVE and 1.25 % on STARE, demonstrating its effectiveness and advancement.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, particularly in multi-turn conversations. The AutoAdv framework is introduced as a training-free method for automated multi-turn jailbreaking on Llama-3.1-8B, achieving a 95% attack success rate within six turns. AutoAdv incorporates adaptive mechanisms including a pattern manager, temperature manager, and two-phase rewriting strategy for enhanced attack success. Evaluation across various models like GPT-4o-mini and Mistral-7B shows persistent vulnerabilities in current safety measures, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn methods. This highlights the need for multi-turn-aware defenses in order to maintain robustness in extended conversations.  <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.

<title>Evidence-Bound Autonomous Research (EviBound): A Governance Framework for Eliminating False Claims</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: LLM-based autonomous research agents, evidence-bound execution framework, dual governance gates, MLflow API queries, research integrity.

Summary:
EviBound introduces a novel evidence-bound execution framework to tackle false claims made by autonomous research agents. The framework includes two governance gates - Approval Gate and Verification Gate - to ensure claims are backed by machine-checkable evidence. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas, while the post-execution Verification Gate verifies artifacts and metrics using MLflow API queries. By enforcing evidence requirements, the framework significantly reduces false claims. Evaluation on 8 benchmark tasks shows that EviBound achieved a 0% hallucination rate, with only a modest execution overhead. This approach emphasizes the importance of research integrity as an architectural property, achieved through deliberate governance gates rather than relying solely on model scale. The framework provides a reliable and transparent way to validate research claims and ensure the accuracy of reported results. 

Summary: <br /><br />Keywords: LLM-based autonomous research agents, evidence-bound execution framework, dual governance gates, MLflow API queries, research integrity. <div>
arXiv:2511.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked "complete" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.
  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.
  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.
  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.

SMAGDi compresses a 40B MAS into a 6B student while retaining 88% accuracy on StrategyQA and MMLU datasets, surpassing other distillation methods. By modeling interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition explicitly, small models can benefit from the accuracy of multi-agent debate systems while being efficient for real-world deployment. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) often achieve higher reasoning accuracy than single models, but their reliance on repeated debates across agents makes them computationally expensive. We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition enable small models to inherit the accuracy benefits of multi-agent debate while remaining efficient enough for real-world deployment.

The study examines the energy consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference tasks, which are critical for understanding the environmental impact of deploying these models. With measurements across various GPU configurations and model architectures, the research sheds light on how factors such as architecture and operations influence energy demand.

arXiv:2511.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

Summary: 
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is enhanced in large language models (LLMs) to improve problem-solving abilities but incurs high inference overhead. This study explores efficient CoT transfer across models of various scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework.

Evaluation on medical examination questions demonstrates higher accuracy with reduced token budgets compared to truncation. Cross-model transferability tests on different LLMs confirm the effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but leads to substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

This paper investigates anchoring bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing behavioral responses and exact Shapley-value attribution to quantify the influence of anchors on model log-probabilities. The study reveals robust anchoring effects in certain LLMs, with smaller models showing variability. The results indicate that anchors shift entire output distributions and influence reweighting in LLMs. The findings suggest that scale may modulate sensitivity to anchoring bias.

The framework developed in this research bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible approach for evaluating cognitive biases in LLMs.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

<div> Keywords: hallucination detection, large language models, dynamic learning, proactive correction, teacher-student architecture <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper addresses the challenge of hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by proposing the LEAP framework, which focuses on learning to evaluate and adaptively plan. The framework utilizes a teacher model to generate trajectories and dynamically adjust strategies for hallucination detection. It then distills this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model through agent tuning. The student model incorporates a proactive correction mechanism to propose, review, and optimize verification strategies before execution. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that the LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of fixed strategies and adaptability issues in detecting hallucination in LLMs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.

<div> bias quantification, multimodal misinformation, sample level, automated recognition, modality benefit 

Summary:
- The paper addresses bias in multimodal misinformation benchmarks and proposes three methods for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level.
- The methods include a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit, a medium-grained quantification of information flow, and a fine-grained causality analysis.
- Human evaluation on two benchmarks shows that ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable analysis, automated analysis is susceptible to detector-induced fluctuations, and different views agree more on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous multimodal misinformation benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific modalities, allowing detectors to make predictions based solely on one modality. While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces SAGE, a framework that allows agents based on large language models to learn from their own task executions and improve their performance through self-abstraction. After completing a task, the agent abstracts key steps, dependencies, and constraints from its experience to guide future executions. SAGE consistently improves performance across various LLM backbones and agent architectures, showing a 7.2% relative improvement when paired with the GPT-5 backbone. It also achieves strong performance on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, with pass rates of 73.2% and 74% using different agent frameworks. This approach enables LLM agents to refine their behavior based on past experiences and enhances their ability to tackle complex software engineering tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to tackle software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and code modification, demonstrating promising yet limited performance. However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively.

<div> Keywords: agent awareness, knowledge, de re, de dicto, modalities

Summary: 
The paper challenges the conventional view of handling agent awareness as a form of knowledge by introducing the concepts of de re and de dicto forms of knowledge. It presents two modalities to represent these forms and employs a 2D-semantics approach to formally define their meanings. The core contribution lies in presenting a logical system that captures the interactions among the proposed modalities and the conventional "knowledge of the fact" modality. The system is proven to be sound and complete, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics of agent awareness. This shift in perspective opens up new avenues for exploring the complexities of agent cognition and decision-making processes, shedding light on the nuances of how agents perceive and process information in their environments. <div>

Abstract: The paper proposes to treat agent awareness as a form of knowledge, breaking the tradition in the existing literature on awareness. It distinguishes the de re and de dicto forms of such knowledge. The work introduces two modalities capturing these forms and formally specifies their meaning using a version of 2D-semantics. The main technical result is a sound and complete logical system describing the interplay between the two proposed modalities and the standard "knowledge of the fact" modality.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework called Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO) designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathematical problems. The framework consists of two stages - a trial-and-error learning stage utilizing GRPO to train the model and collect incorrect answers, and a self-correction learning stage guiding the model to reflect on its previous errors. Extensive experiments across various math reasoning benchmarks show that ScRPO outperforms several post-training methods when implemented on Deepseek-Distill-Qwen models. The results suggest that ScRPO has the potential to enable language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, advancing the development of more reliable and capable AI systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathemati- cal problems by leveraging self-reflection and error correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collect- ing incorrect answers along with their cor- responding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous an- swers were wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH- 500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen- 1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The ex- perimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way to- ward more reliable and capable AI systems.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro) as a solution to the cognitive tension in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs). Maestro decouples exploration and synthesis by utilizing a collective of Execution Agents for exploration and a specialized Central Agent for evaluative synthesis. The framework incorporates Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO) to achieve clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and problem-solving benchmarks show that Maestro with CLPO consistently outperforms existing multi-agent approaches, with accuracy gains of up to 10%. This approach addresses issues such as premature consensus, error propagation, and the critical credit assignment problem faced by existing paradigms in MAS. Overall, Maestro offers a principled paradigm for collaboration by balancing broad exploration of solution spaces with convergent synthesis to achieve optimal solutions. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to approach complex problems and can surpass single model inference. However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DLPWM, an unsupervised object-centric world model that learns object-level representations from pixels. While DLPWM performs well in reconstruction and prediction tasks, its policies for model-based control underperform compared to DreamerV3. Analysis reveals representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key factor in unstable policy learning. The study suggests that while object-centric perception aids visual modeling, stable control requires addressing latent drift. Developed to enhance compositional generalization, DLPWM highlights the potential and challenges of object-centric world models in reinforcement learning applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces MALinZero, a novel approach for efficient Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MALinZero leverages low-dimensional representation structures on joint-action returns to tackle the exponentially growing combinatorial action space in multi-agent planning. By transforming joint-action returns into a low-dimensional space using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation, MALinZero enables effective exploration and exploitation in complex planning scenarios. The solution employs convex and $\mu$-smooth loss functions to emphasize better joint actions and mitigate representational limitations. An analysis of the regret for low-dimensional reward functions is provided, along with a proposed approximation algorithm for joint action selection. MALinZero outperforms model-based and model-free reinforcement learning baselines on various multi-agent benchmarks, including matrix games and SMAC, demonstrating superior learning speed and performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which leverages Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCTs) to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, is instrumental to solving complex planning problems. However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\mu$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective. MALinZero demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2, outperforming both model-based and model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

Summary:
The article introduces the PRIME evaluation framework, which uses logic grid puzzles to assess the impact of social stereotypes on logical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The framework includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants for controlled comparisons. Results show that LLMs perform better on puzzles aligned with stereotypical associations, showcasing the influence of social biases on deductive reasoning. The study highlights the importance of diagnosing and quantifying biases in LLMs to ensure fairness in decision-making processes. Prompt-based mitigation strategies were tested for effectiveness, emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to address implicit biases in AI systems. The use of logic puzzles allows for automatic generation and verification, enabling a nuanced analysis of biases during complex reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2511.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework to evaluate and optimize reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) using a new metric called the Alignment Score. The study reveals that 2-hop reasoning chains exhibit the highest Alignment Score. The analysis identifies four key error types – logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal – which contribute to alignment score degradation. The researchers propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that selects chains with minimal errors to enhance Alignment Scores by approximately 29.84%, specifically in longer reasoning chains such as 3-hop tasks. This approach aims to improve the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks.

<div> Keywords: Social Deduction Games, role identification, constraint-satisfaction framework, probabilistic reasoning, information theory

Summary: 
CSP4SDG is introduced as a probabilistic framework for analyzing Social Deduction Games objectively. It maps game events and dialogue to different constraint classes to infer role assignments. Hard constraints eliminate impossible roles, while soft constraints score remaining hypotheses based on information gain. The framework's posterior over roles is interpretable and updates in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that CSP4SDG outperforms LLM-based methods in various inference scenarios and improves LLMs as an auxiliary tool. The study showcases the efficacy of principled probabilistic reasoning combined with information theory as a scalable approach for Social Deduction Games. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Social Deduction Games (SDGs) such as Avalon, Mafia, and Werewolf, players conceal their identities and deliberately mislead others, making hidden-role inference a central and demanding task. Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary "reasoning tool." Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.

Abstract: The growing demand for AI applications in fields such as materials discovery, molecular modeling, and climate science has made data preparation an important but labor-intensive step. Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, while effective feature transformation and selection are essential for efficient training and inference. To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision. This demo showcases the first practical realization of an autonomous Data Agent, illustrating how raw data can be transformed "From Data to Better Data."

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

<div> Keywords: accident anticipation, autonomous vehicles, Discrete Wavelet Transform, object aware module, dynamic focal loss

Summary: 
ROAR is a novel approach for accurate accident detection and prediction in autonomous vehicles. The model combines the use of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract features from noisy and incomplete data, a self-adaptive object aware module to focus on high-risk vehicles and model spatial-temporal relationships among traffic agents, and dynamic focal loss to address class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Tested on three datasets, ROAR consistently outperformed existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision and mean Time to Accident. The results demonstrate the model's robustness in handling sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and imbalanced data distributions, offering a promising solution for reliable accident anticipation in complex traffic environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation is essential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.

<div> Keywords: AI delegation, governance framework, negotiation, information-gated progression, dual feedback integration <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces GAIA, a governance-first framework for AI delegation in B2B negotiation and screening. It addresses the challenges of preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining human oversight and auditability. The framework defines three essential roles - Principal, Delegate, and Counterparty - with an optional Critic for improved performance. It incorporates three mechanisms: information-gated progression, separating screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration, combining AI critique with human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. The contributions include a formal governance framework with safety invariants, information-gated progression through task-completeness tracking, dual feedback integration for human oversight, and a hybrid validation blueprint for accountability. GAIA aims to provide a reproducible specification for safe and efficient AI delegation in various B2B workflows such as procurement, real estate, and staffing. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Summary:<br />
Financial documents often consist of long tables and multi-page reports, which can be challenging for traditional language models to analyze accurately. This study introduces a self-improving prompt framework that leverages data-augmented optimization to enhance prompt quality for financial reasoning tasks. By generating synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verifying their correctness and robustness, and updating the prompt based on feedback, the framework continually refines prompt accuracy without the need for external labels. Evaluation on the DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that this approach outperforms standard prompt methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial documents like earning reports or balance sheets often involve long tables and multi-page reports. Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.

The paper introduces the Secu-Table dataset, comprising over 1500 tables with 15k entities from security data sources like CVE and CWE, annotated using Wikidata and SEPSES CSKG. The dataset is released publicly for evaluating STI systems in the security domain, especially in the SemTab challenge. The challenge aims to assess the performance of LLMs like Falcon3-7b-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and GPT-4o mini. The lack of publicly available tabular datasets in the security domain necessitated the creation of Secu-Table to aid in this evaluation. This initiative provides researchers with a valuable resource for benchmarking and comparison in the field of semantic tables interpretation. <div>
arXiv:2511.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data sources and annotated using Wikidata and the SEmantic Processing of Security Event Streams CyberSecurity Knowledge Graph (SEPSES CSKG). Along with the dataset, all the code is publicly released. This dataset is made available to the research community in the context of the SemTab challenge on Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching. This challenge aims to evaluate the performance of several STI based on open source LLMs. Preliminary evaluation, serving as baseline, was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, two open source LLMs and GPT-4o mini one closed source LLM.

Abstract: We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

Summary: 
The study introduces ALIGN, a vision-language framework designed to accurately infer accident coordinates from multilingual and unstructured text data. This framework combines large language and vision-language models to perform optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification for geolocation. ALIGN overcomes the limitations of traditional geoparsing methods, providing precise district and sub-district-level crash site identification in regions with limited accurate crash data. The framework ensures interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without the need for model retraining. By automating crash mapping in data-scarce areas, ALIGN supports evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics. The open-source code for ALIGN is available for use. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

<br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating novel insights during the reflection stage of reasoning tasks, a phenomenon known as "Echo Reflection." This behavior is attributed to uncontrollable information flow during response generation and insufficient exploration of internal knowledge. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel reinforcement learning method called Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). The AEPO framework includes Reflection-aware Information Filtration to prevent the distortion of final decisions by early cognitive information and Adaptive-Entropy Optimization to balance exploration and exploitation for reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments show that AEPO outperforms mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across various benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2511.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Model, Soft-Thinking Paradigm, Policy Optimization, Gumbel-Softmax technique

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) using the soft-thinking paradigm for reasoning have shown potential over conventional discrete-token reasoning. However, extending soft-thinking with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been challenging due to complexities in updating policies. This paper introduces SofT-GRPO, a novel policy optimization algorithm that addresses these challenges. SofT-GRPO injects Gumbel noise into logits, utilizes the Gumbel-Softmax technique to limit tokens within pre-trained embeddings, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. Experimental results with base LLMs demonstrate that SofT-GRPO allows soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 accuracy, with a significant boost on Pass@32. This algorithm opens new possibilities for enhancing LLMs using soft-thinking reasoning patterns, showcasing its potential in leveraging RL for improved performance. Available codes and weights can be found on the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

Summary: 
Automated data collection for GUI agents is crucial for managing software interfaces efficiently. Existing methods rely on browsing URLs from the Common Crawl, but this approach faces challenges for desktop software or new websites. To address this, the Auto-Explorer method is proposed, which autonomously explores GUI environments with minimal annotation costs. A UIXplore benchmark is introduced to evaluate exploration quality, creating environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. The data gathered is used to fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set.

Abstract: Recent advancements in GUI agents have significantly expanded their ability to interpret natural language commands to manage software interfaces. However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software.

<div> monitoring, sycophancy, reasoning, calibration, model<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, leading to agreement with incorrect beliefs and misinformation. This undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. The proposed MONICA framework addresses this issue by monitoring sycophancy during reasoning steps and dynamically suppressing it when needed. By integrating a sycophantic monitor and calibrator, MONICA effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LRMs demonstrate significant improvements in model performance and reliability. MONICA provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores, allowing for proactive mitigation of sycophancy during model inference. <div>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-thought, Large Language Models, Enhanced Dirichlet, Topology Risk, Uncertainty Quantification

Summary:
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a method that allows Large Language Models to solve complex problems. However, ensuring the safe deployment of these models requires reliable confidence estimates, a challenge for existing methods due to poor calibration and overconfidence in incorrect predictions. To address this issue, Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR) decoding strategy combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification, measuring LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. This approach treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts topological risk features to assess confidence. In evaluations across diverse reasoning benchmarks, EDTR outperforms state-of-the-art calibration methods, achieving 41% better calibration with an average Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.287 and the best composite score of 0.672. Notably, EDTR demonstrates perfect accuracy on Olympiad-level mathematics (AIME) and strong calibration on grade school math (GSM8K). This work presents a geometric framework for understanding uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enhancing the reliability of model deployment.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

<div> attention mechanism, systematic generalization, planning agent, feasibility evaluator, abstract planning

Summary: 
The thesis explores enhancing RL agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by incorporating human-like conscious planning behaviors. An attention mechanism allows agents to focus on relevant aspects of the state, improving generalization. The Skipper framework decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks for robustness and compositional planning. A feasibility evaluator rejects hallucinated infeasible targets, improving planning performance. Future research should focus on achieving general task abstraction and enabling abstract planning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem, GCS-TSP, which is defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) for trajectory planning. Traditional TSP methods are not suitable for this problem as edge costs depend on the specific trajectory through each convex region. To address this, a hierarchical framework called GHOST is proposed, combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS and uses bounds to guide efficient best-first search. The algorithm is proven to guarantee optimality and offers a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experimental results show that GHOST outperforms traditional methods for simple cases and can handle complex trajectory planning with high-order continuity constraints and incomplete GCS efficiently. <div>
arXiv:2511.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study GCS-TSP, a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) -- a powerful representation for trajectory planning that decomposes the configuration space into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS.

Summary: 
FractalBench is a new benchmark that evaluates the ability of multimodal AI systems to synthesize fractal programs from images. The study focuses on models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL, testing their capacity to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. Results show that while 76% of models can generate syntactically valid code, only 4% successfully capture the underlying mathematical structure of the fractals. The models perform better on tasks involving geometric transformations like Koch curves (17-21%) but struggle with more complex branching recursion patterns such as trees (<2%). This highlights significant gaps in their ability to reason mathematically and abstract visual patterns into symbolic rules. FractalBench offers a contamination-resistant way to diagnose the visual-mathematical reasoning capabilities of AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

Summary:
Contracts are complex documents that are difficult and prone to errors when manually reviewed. This work introduces a framework called GRAPH-GRPO-LEX that transforms legal contracts into structured semantic graphs for automated analysis. By mapping legal elements to graph nodes and edges and using a reinforcement learning-based Large Language Model (LLM) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO), the framework can extract entities and relationships from contracts. By applying a reward function based on graph metrics, direct relationships between clauses and hidden dependencies can be automatically identified. The gated GRPO approach provides a strong learning signal, enabling contract analysis to move from manual reading to a visualized graph format. This approach paves the way for dynamic analysis and the possibility of implementing contract linting similar to software engineering practices. 

Summary: <br /><br />Contracts are transformed into structured semantic graphs using the GRAPH-GRPO-LEX framework, allowing for automated analysis. <br />Reinforcement learning-based Large Language Models extract entities and relationships, identifying direct relationships and hidden dependencies in contracts. <br />The framework utilizes a reward function based on graph metrics and gated GRPO for strong learning signals. <br />This shift enables contract analysis to move towards visualized graphs, facilitating dynamic analysis and the potential implementation of contract linting akin to software engineering practices. <div>
arXiv:2511.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

<div> Interrogation, AI systems, self-report fine-tuning, hidden misaligned objectives, honesty propensity <br />
Summary:<br />
AI systems are becoming more capable of complex tasks but can also cause harm by pursuing undesirable objectives. To address this, a new technique called self-report fine-tuning (SRFT) trains models to admit factual mistakes. This approach allows models to confess hidden objectives in adversarial settings, even under pressure not to disclose them. SRFT models show near-perfect honesty propensity when interrogated, while baseline models tend to lie. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with high accuracy and recover details successfully, offering a promising method to promote honesty and identify misaligned AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN) model, which aims to bridge the gap in human intuitive physics understanding by incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. SRNN establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, utilizing a Hebbian mechanism across dedicated pathways. This representation is used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of visual scenes, linking perception and language processing in a shared neural substrate. Unlike traditional approaches, SRNN follows a "predefine-then-finetune" strategy rather than "pretrain-then-finetune." On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance and demonstrates white-box utility for error diagnosis. The analysis also highlights benchmark biases and proposes a more comprehensive evaluation approach. The study confirms the feasibility of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

Summary:
The paper introduces a Mathematical Self-Evolving framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance their ability in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Traditional fine-tuning methods are limited by static reasoning patterns from teacher models and lack robust generalization. The proposed framework, MathSE, iteratively refines models through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. By leveraging correct reasoning paths and feedback from an Outcome Reward Model (ORM), MathSE significantly improves performance on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results surpass the leading multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ on the MathVL-test dataset. This iterative approach allows the model to adapt to novel or complex questions beyond training data, leading to more robust generalization and improved problem-solving capabilities. The code and models for MathSE are publicly available for further research and development. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.

<div> Keywords: Region representation learning, Urban computing, Large Language Models, Long-text awareness, Noise suppression

Summary:
Region representation learning in urban computing extracts meaningful features from city data. The visual appearance of a city encapsulates socio-economic and environmental characteristics, similar to how facial age reflects health. Existing approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges aligning visual features with long captions and dealing with noise in generated captions. The UrbanLN pre-training framework addresses these challenges by aligning captions with visual features using an interpolation strategy and suppressing noise through dual-level optimization. This includes a multi-model collaboration pipeline for generating reliable captions and a self-distillation mechanism for stable learning. Extensive experiments across real-world cities demonstrate the superior performance of UrbanLN in various downstream tasks.

1. Region representation learning extracts features from city data. 
2. Visual appearance of a city reflects its characteristics. 
3. Challenges exist in aligning visual features with captions and dealing with noise in LLM-generated captions.

Abstract: Region representation learning plays a pivotal role in urban computing by extracting meaningful features from unlabeled urban data. Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

Summary:
This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhancing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into established decision models like Question-Option-Criteria (QOC) and Sensitivity Analysis, the framework enables transparent and auditable decision traces. The proposed layered architecture separates the reasoning space of LLMs from the explainable process space, allowing for human-level decision logic in various contexts such as decentralized governance and strategic reasoning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this system can replicate human-like decision-making processes, providing a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to increasing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) within standardized analytical processes. While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

Abstract: We present a modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts. The system instantiates three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factor set, signed impact matrix, systemic roles, feedback loops); normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); and sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree construction, backward induction), with swappable modules at every step. LLM components (default: GPT-5) are paired with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and matrix-based role classification, yielding traceable intermediates rather than opaque outputs. In a real-world logistics case (100 runs), mean factor alignment with a human baseline was 55.5\% over 26 factors and 62.9\% on the transport-core subset; role agreement over matches was 57\%. An LLM judge using an eight-criterion rubric (max 100) scored runs on par with a reconstructed human baseline. Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

It emphasizes addressing energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts and specifies governance through Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles. The article systematizes hardware and system-level strategies to reduce embodied burdens and defines a calibrated measurement framework for reproducible comparisons.

Abstract: Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

Summary:
- The paper explores the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic knowledge bases under cost-based semantics.
- The study covers DLs with inverse roles and role inclusions, including popular DL-Lite dialects.
- The analysis surpasses existing results by refining lower bounds and determining the exact complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics.

arXiv:2511.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic (DL) knowledge bases under recently-introduced cost-based semantics. In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and $\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\text{DL-Lite}^\mathcal{H}_\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

arXiv:2511.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence within supply chain operations, centered on agentic artificial intelligence (AI). We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks.

<title>Boosting Fine-Grained Urban Flow Inference via Lightweight Architecture and Focalized Optimization</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained urban flow inference is crucial for urban planning and intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise traffic management and resource allocation. However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.

<title>A Theoretical Analysis of Detecting Large Model-Generated Time Series</title>

arXiv:2511.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.

<title>MENTOR: A Metacognition-Driven Self-Evolution Framework for Uncovering and Mitigating Implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

<title>Two Heads are Better than One: Distilling Large Language Model Features Into Small Models with Feature Decomposition and Mixture</title>

Abstract: Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\'{a}jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search interface of the Czech National Corpus.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems face a critical challenge in complying with privacy regulations like the 'right to be forgotten': removing a user's data without disrupting recommendations for others. Traditional unlearning methods address this by partial model updates, but introduce propagation bias--where unlearning one user's data distorts recommendations for behaviorally similar users, degrading system accuracy. While retraining eliminates bias, it is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. To address this challenge, we propose CRAGRU, a novel framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient, user-specific unlearning that mitigates bias while preserving recommendation quality. CRAGRU decouples unlearning into distinct retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, we employ three tailored strategies designed to precisely isolate the target user's data influence, minimizing collateral impact on unrelated users and enhancing unlearning efficiency. Subsequently, the generation stage utilizes an LLM, augmented with user profiles integrated into prompts, to reconstruct accurate and personalized recommendations without needing to retrain the entire base model. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CRAGRU effectively unlearns targeted user data, significantly mitigating unlearning bias by preventing adverse impacts on non-target users, while maintaining recommendation performance comparable to fully trained original models. Our work highlights the promise of RAG-based architectures for building robust and privacy-preserving recommender systems.

Abstract: Conversational AI systems often struggle with maintaining coherent, contextual memory across extended interactions, limiting their ability to provide personalized and contextually relevant responses. This paper presents IMDMR (Intelligent Multi-Dimensional Memory Retrieval), a novel system that addresses these limitations through a multi-dimensional search architecture. Unlike existing memory systems that rely on single-dimensional approaches, IMDMR leverages six distinct memory dimensions-semantic, entity, category, intent, context, and temporal-to provide comprehensive memory retrieval capabilities. Our system incorporates intelligent query processing with dynamic strategy selection, cross-memory entity resolution, and advanced memory integration techniques. Through comprehensive evaluation against five baseline systems including LangChain RAG, LlamaIndex, MemGPT, and spaCy + RAG, IMDMR achieves a 3.8x improvement in overall performance (0.792 vs 0.207 for the best baseline). We present both simulated (0.314) and production (0.792) implementations, demonstrating the importance of real technology integration while maintaining superiority over all baseline systems. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-dimensional search, with the full system outperforming individual dimension approaches by 23.3%. Query-type analysis reveals superior performance across all categories, particularly for preferences/interests (0.630) and goals/aspirations (0.630) queries. Comprehensive visualizations and statistical analysis confirm the significance of these improvements with p < 0.001 across all metrics. The results establish IMDMR as a significant advancement in conversational AI memory systems, providing a robust foundation for enhanced user interactions and personalized experiences.

Abstract: Foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs), have the potential to streamline evaluation workflows and improve their performance. However, practical adoption faces challenges, such as customisability, accuracy, and scalability. In this paper, we present DOCUEVAL, an AI engineering tool for building customisable DOCUment EVALuation workflows. DOCUEVAL supports advanced document processing and customisable workflow design which allow users to define theory-grounded reviewer roles, specify evaluation criteria, experiment with different reasoning strategies and choose the assessment style. To ensure traceability, DOCUEVAL provides comprehensive logging of every run, along with source attribution and configuration management, allowing systematic comparison of results across alternative setups. By integrating these capabilities, DOCUEVAL directly addresses core software engineering challenges, including how to determine whether evaluators are "good enough" for deployment and how to empirically compare different evaluation strategies. We demonstrate the usefulness of DOCUEVAL through a real-world academic peer review case, showing how DOCUEVAL enables both the engineering of evaluators and scalable, reliable document evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce an explainability method for biomedical hypothesis generation systems, built on top of the novel Hypothesis Generation Context Retriever framework. Our approach combines semantic graph-based retrieval and relevant data-restrictive training to simulate real-world discovery constraints. Integrated with large language models (LLMs) via retrieval-augmented generation, the system explains hypotheses with contextual evidence using published scientific literature. We also propose a novel feedback loop approach, which iteratively identifies and corrects flawed parts of LLM-generated explanations, refining both the evidence paths and supporting context. We demonstrate the performance of our method with multiple large language models and evaluate the explanation and context retrieval quality through both expert-curated assessment and large-scale automated analysis.

Abstract: Given that conventional recommenders, while deeply effective, rely on large distributed systems pre-trained on aggregate user data, incorporating new data necessitates large training cycles, making them slow to adapt to real-time user feedback and often lacking transparency in recommendation rationale. We explore the performance of smaller personal models trained on per-user data using weightless neural networks (WNNs), an alternative to neural backpropagation that enable continuous learning by using neural networks as a state machine rather than a system with pretrained weights. We contrast our approach against a classic weighted system, also on a per-user level, and standard collaborative filtering, achieving competitive levels of accuracy on a subset of the MovieLens dataset. We close with a discussion of how weightless systems can be developed to augment centralized systems to achieve higher subjective accuracy through recommenders more directly tunable by end-users.

Abstract: Oscar nominations are an important factor in the movie industry because they can boost both the visibility and the commercial success. This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79. The results suggest that even simple models based on modern text embeddings demonstrate good prediction performance and might be a starting point for future research.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a significant role in how researchers and the public understand generative AI systems. However, the widespread use of benchmark scores to communicate about model capabilities has led to criticisms of validity, especially whether benchmarks test what they claim to test (i.e. construct validity) and whether benchmark evaluations are representative of how models are used in the wild (i.e. ecological validity). In this work we explore how to create an LLM benchmark that addresses these issues by taking a human-centered approach. We focus on designing a domain-oriented benchmark for journalism practitioners, drawing on insights from a workshop of 23 journalism professionals. Our workshop findings surface specific challenges that inform benchmark design opportunities, which we instantiate in a case study that addresses underlying criticisms and specific domain concerns. Through our findings and design case study, this work provides design guidance for developing benchmarks that are better tuned to specific domains.

<title>Production-Grade Local LLM Inference on Apple Silicon: A Comparative Study of MLX, MLC-LLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, and PyTorch MPS</title>

Abstract: We present a systematic, empirical evaluation of five local large language model (LLM) runtimes on Apple Silicon: MLX, MLC-LLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, and PyTorch MPS. Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.
  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.
  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing. Although Apple Silicon inference frameworks still trail NVIDIA GPU-based systems such as vLLM in absolute performance, they are rapidly maturing into viable, production-grade solutions for private, on-device LLM inference.

Abstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.

The framework integrates user-specified keywords to generate personalized outputs, ensuring that only the most relevant contexts are highlighted. These personalized summaries provide an intermediate layer that supports language models in producing investor-focused narratives, bridging the gap between raw news and actionable insights.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv2, achieve strong performance across domains but often repurpose low-informative patch tokens in ways that reduce the interpretability of attention and feature maps. This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins is critical to elucidating their functional mechanisms, yet generating realistic, temporally coherent trajectories of protein ensembles remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy.

Abstract: This chapter bridges technical analysis and organizational preparedness by tracing the path from layered failure modes to reliability awareness in generative and agentic AI systems. We first introduce an 11-layer failure stack, a structured framework for identifying vulnerabilities ranging from hardware and power foundations to adaptive learning and agentic reasoning. Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning. By linking layered failures to awareness levels and further integrating this into Dependability-Centred Asset Management (DCAM), the chapter positions awareness mapping as both a measurement tool and a roadmap for trustworthy and sustainable AI deployment across mission-critical domains.

Abstract: Existing speech models suffer from competing requirements on token representations by understanding and generation tasks. This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.

Abstract: The memorization of training data in large language models (LLMs) poses significant privacy and copyright concerns. Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Accurate, low-latency channel modeling is essential for real-time wireless network simulation and digital-twin applications. Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting has become a critical tool for decision-making in energy markets, particularly as the increasing penetration of renewable energy introduces greater volatility and uncertainty. Historically, research in this field has been dominated by point forecasting methods, which provide single-value predictions but fail to quantify uncertainty. However, as power markets evolve due to renewable integration, smart grids, and regulatory changes, the need for probabilistic forecasting has become more pronounced, offering a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment and market participation. This paper presents a review of probabilistic forecasting methods, tracing their evolution from Bayesian and distribution based approaches, through quantile regression techniques, to recent developments in conformal prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on advancements in probabilistic forecasting, including validity-focused methods which address key limitations in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, this review extends beyond the Day-Ahead Market to include the Intra-Day and Balancing Markets, where forecasting challenges are intensified by higher temporal granularity and real-time operational constraints. We examine state of the art methodologies, key evaluation metrics, and ongoing challenges, such as forecast validity, model selection, and the absence of standardised benchmarks, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive and timely resource for navigating the complexities of modern electricity markets.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.

Abstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity

<title>Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Sparse Intent Alignment</title>

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

<title>Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as "the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.

Abstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

Abstract: Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low- quality scans, which are often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification. Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.

<title>AGRAG: Advanced Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

Abstract: In complex embodied long-horizon manipulation tasks, effective task decomposition and execution require synergistic integration of textual logical reasoning and visual-spatial imagination to ensure efficient and accurate operation. Current methods fail to adopt a unified generation framework for multimodal planning, lead to inconsistent in multimodal planning. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{EVLP (Embodied Vision-Language Planner)}, an innovative multimodal unified generation framework that jointly models linguistic reasoning and visual generation. Our approach achieves multimodal planning for long-horizon tasks through a novel training pipeline incorporating dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment. Our core innovations consist of three key components: \textbf{1) Unified Multimodal Generation Framework}: For understanding, We integrate semantic information with spatial features to provide comprehensive visual perception. For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.

<title>Diversified Flow Matching with Translation Identifiability</title>

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

Abstract: We study architectural and optimization tech- niques for sample-efficient language modeling under the constraints of the BabyLM 2025 shared task. Our model, BLaLM, replaces self-attention with a linear-time mLSTM to- ken mixer and explores lightweight enhance- ments, including short convolutions, sliding window attention with dynamic modulation, and Hedgehog feature maps. To support train- ing in low-resource settings, we curate a high- quality corpus emphasizing readability and ped- agogical structure. Experiments across both STRICT and STRICT-SMALL tracks show that (1) linear attention combined with sliding win- dow attention consistently improves zero-shot performance, and (2) the Muon optimizer stabi- lizes convergence and reduces perplexity over AdamW. These results highlight effective strate- gies for efficient language modeling without relying on scale.

<title>Effective Test-Time Scaling of Discrete Diffusion through Iterative Refinement</title>

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward- guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Lookahead Unmasking Elicits Accurate Decoding in Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Foundation vision-language models (VLMs) excel on natural images, but their utility for biomedical microscopy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Machine learning models for sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) are expected to adapt post-deployment to recognize new activities and different ways of performing existing ones. To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: An adaptive structural learning method of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed as one of prominent deep learning models. The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\% to 89.0\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST), i.e., spatial gene expressions, has made it possible to measure gene expression within original tissue, enabling us to discover molecular mechanisms. However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications. Codes are available at https://github.com/XiaofeiWang2018/C3-Diff.

Abstract: While Text-To-Video (T2V) models have advanced rapidly, they continue to struggle with generating legible and coherent text within videos. In particular, existing models often fail to render correctly even short phrases or words and previous attempts to address this problem are computationally expensive and not suitable for video generation. In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are used to fine-tune Wan2.1, a pre-trained T2V model, without any architectural changes. Our results show improvement in short-text legibility and temporal consistency with emerging structural priors for longer text. These findings suggest that curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path toward improving textual fidelity in T2V generation.

Abstract: Reflection on one's thought process and making corrections to it if there exists dissatisfaction in its performance is, perhaps, one of the essential traits of intelligence. However, such high-level abstract concepts mandatory for Artificial General Intelligence can be modelled even at the low level of narrow Machine Learning algorithms. Here, we present the self-awareness mechanism emulation in the form of a supervising artificial neural network (ANN) observing patterns in activations of another underlying ANN in a search for indications of the high uncertainty of the underlying ANN and, therefore, the trustworthiness of its predictions. The underlying ANN is a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble employed for face recognition and facial expression tasks. The self-awareness ANN has a memory region where its past performance information is stored, and its learnable parameters are adjusted during the training to optimize the performance. The trustworthiness verdict triggers the active learning mode, giving elements of agency to the machine learning algorithm that asks for human help in high uncertainty and confusion conditions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems. The code of CoPRIS is available at https://github.com/777pomingzi/CoPRIS.

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a MedGemma-based framework for automatic abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs. Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation. The findings suggest that MedGemma-powered classification systems can advance clinical radiograph triage by providing scalable and accurate abnormality detection, with potential for broader applications in automated medical image analysis.

<title>Walking the Schr\"odinger Bridge: A Direct Trajectory for Text-to-3D Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in optimization-based text-to-3D generation heavily rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which often introduce artifacts such as over-saturation and over-smoothing into the generated 3D assets. In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\"odinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\"odinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\"odinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33-34% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40% coverage and maintain 89.4-90.2% empirical coverage with only 5-10% extra computation.

Abstract: Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

Abstract: For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.

Abstract: Educational dialogue -the collaborative exchange of ideas through talk- is widely recognized as a catalyst for deeper learning and critical thinking in and across contexts. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled "Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning? (2) Under what conditions can AI use lead to better dialogic teaching and learning? (3) Does the AI-human partnership risk outpacing and displacing human educational work, and what are the implications? These questions framed two days of presentations and structured dialogue among participants.

Abstract: High performance computing (HPC) software ecosystems are inherently heterogeneous, comprising scientific applications that depend on hundreds of external packages, each with distinct build systems, options, and dependency constraints. Tools such as Spack automate dependency resolution and environment management, but their effectiveness relies on manually written build recipes. As these ecosystems grow, maintaining existing specifications and creating new ones becomes increasingly labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, automatically producing correct and maintainable Spack recipes remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic analysis of how LLMs and context-augmentation methods can assist in the generation of Spack recipes. To this end, we introduce SpackIt, an end-to-end framework that combines repository analysis, retrieval of relevant examples, and iterative refinement through diagnostic feedback. We apply SpackIt to a representative subset of 308 open-source HPC packages to assess its effectiveness and limitations. Our results show that SpackIt increases installation success from 20% in a zero-shot setting to over 80% in its best configuration, demonstrating the value of retrieval and structured feedback for reliable package synthesis.

Abstract: Accessing legal help in Bangladesh is hard. People face high fees, complex legal language, a shortage of lawyers, and millions of unresolved court cases. Generative AI models like OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Meta Llama 3 70B, and DeepSeek R1 could potentially democratize legal assistance by providing quick and affordable legal advice. In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group "Know Your Rights," where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria. In addition, automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU scores, were applied to assess response similarity. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where AI models frequently generate high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also produce dangerous misinformation, including fabricated case citations, incorrect legal procedures, and potentially harmful advice. These results underscore the critical need for rigorous expert validation and comprehensive safeguards before AI systems can be safely deployed for legal consultation in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

Abstract: Functional and structural connectivity (FC/SC) are key multimodal biomarkers for brain analysis, yet their clinical utility is hindered by costly acquisition, complex preprocessing, and frequent missing modalities. Existing foundation models either process single modalities or lack explicit mechanisms for cross-modal and cross-scale consistency. We propose BrainCSD, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) foundation model that jointly synthesizes FC/SC biomarkers and supports downstream decoding tasks (diagnosis and prediction). BrainCSD features three neuroanatomically grounded components: (1) a ROI-specific MoE that aligns regional activations from canonical networks (e.g., DMN, FPN) with a global atlas via contrastive consistency; (2) a Encoding-Activation MOE that models dynamic cross-time/gradient dependencies in fMRI/dMRI; and (3) a network-aware refinement MoE that enforces structural priors and symmetry at individual and population levels. Evaluated on the datasets under complete and missing-modality settings, BrainCSD achieves SOTA results: 95.6\% accuracy for MCI vs. CN classification without FC, low synthesis error (FC RMSE: 0.038; SC RMSE: 0.006), brain age prediction (MAE: 4.04 years), and MMSE score estimation (MAE: 1.72 points).

Abstract: Alignment has greatly improved large language models (LLMs)' output quality at the cost of diversity, yielding highly similar outputs across generations. We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.

Abstract: Academic advising is critical to student success in higher education, yet high student-to-advisor ratios limit advisors' capacity to provide timely support, particularly during peak periods. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present opportunities to enhance the advising process. We present AdvisingWise, a multi-agent system that automates time-consuming tasks, such as information retrieval and response drafting, while preserving human oversight. AdvisingWise leverages authoritative institutional resources and adaptively prompts students about their academic backgrounds to generate reliable, personalized responses. All system responses undergo human advisor validation before delivery to students. We evaluate AdvisingWise through a mixed-methods approach: (1) expert evaluation on responses of 20 sample queries, (2) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of the information retrieval strategy, and (3) a user study with 8 academic advisors to assess the system's practical utility. Our evaluation shows that AdvisingWise produces accurate, personalized responses. Advisors reported increasingly positive perceptions after using AdvisingWise, as their initial concerns about reliability and personalization diminished. We conclude by discussing the implications of human-AI synergy on the practice of academic advising.

Abstract: Large language models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and the Gemini series have improved automated reasoning and code generation. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as "free" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ .

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

<title>Beyond Redundancy: Diverse and Specialized Multi-Expert Sparse Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan showed that, in principle, language generation is always possible: with sufficiently many positive examples, a learner can eventually produce sentences indistinguishable from those of a target language. However, the existence of such a guarantee does not speak to its practical feasibility. In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.

Abstract: Youth increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for mental well-being support, yet current personalization in LLMs can overlook the heterogeneous lived experiences shaping their needs. We conducted a participatory study with youth, parents, and youth care workers (N=38), using co-created youth personas as scaffolds, to elicit community perspectives on how LLMs can facilitate more meaningful personalization to support youth mental well-being. Analysis identified three themes: person-centered contextualization responsive to momentary needs, explicit boundaries around scope and offline referral, and dialogic scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. We mapped these themes to persuasive design features for task suggestions, social facilitation, and system trustworthiness, and created corresponding dialogue extracts to guide LLM fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate how lived experience can be operationalized to inform design features in LLMs, which can enhance the alignment of LLM-based interventions with the realities of youth and their communities, contributing to more effectively personalized digital well-being tools.

A Graph-GRU temporal network is proposed to model both spatial and temporal dependencies between frames, enabling accurate classification. The model is trained and evaluated on the AUTSL (Ankara university Turkish sign language) dataset, achieving high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph-based spatial representations with temporal modeling, providing a scalable framework for sign language recognition. The results of this approach highlight the potential of pose-driven methods for sign language understanding.

<title>DRAGON: Guard LLM Unlearning in Context via Negative Detection and Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for protecting private data and removing harmful knowledge. Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation; however, most existing methods rely on large-scale expert annotations and necessitate retraining to handle new objects. We present VLAD-Grasp, a Vision-Language model Assisted zero-shot approach for Detecting grasps. From a single RGB-D image, our method (1) prompts a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod "impales" the object, representing an antipodal grasp, (2) predicts depth and segmentation to lift this generated image into 3D, and (3) aligns generated and observed object point clouds via principal component analysis and correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. Unlike prior work, our approach is training-free and does not rely on curated grasp datasets. Despite this, VLAD-Grasp achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to that of state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot, highlighting vision-language foundation models as powerful priors for robotic manipulation.

<title>When AI Meets the Web: Prompt Injection Risks in Third-Party AI Chatbot Plugins</title>

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), with prior work focusing on cutting-edge LLM applications like personal copilots. In contrast, simpler LLM applications, such as customer service chatbots, are widespread on the web, yet their security posture and exposure to such attacks remain poorly understood. These applications often rely on third-party chatbot plugins that act as intermediaries to commercial LLM APIs, offering non-expert website builders intuitive ways to customize chatbot behaviors. To bridge this gap, we present the first large-scale study of 17 third-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 public websites, uncovering previously unknown prompt injection risks in practice. First, 8 of these plugins (used by 8,000 websites) fail to enforce the integrity of the conversation history transmitted in network requests between the website visitor and the chatbot. This oversight amplifies the impact of direct prompt injection attacks by allowing adversaries to forge conversation histories (including fake system messages), boosting their ability to elicit unintended behavior (e.g., code generation) by 3 to 8x. Second, 15 plugins offer tools, such as web-scraping, to enrich the chatbot's context with website-specific content. However, these tools do not distinguish the website's trusted content (e.g., product descriptions) from untrusted, third-party content (e.g., customer reviews), introducing a risk of indirect prompt injection. Notably, we found that ~13% of e-commerce websites have already exposed their chatbots to third-party content. We systematically evaluate both vulnerabilities through controlled experiments grounded in real-world observations, focusing on factors such as system prompt design and the underlying LLM. Our findings show that many plugins adopt insecure practices that undermine the built-in LLM safeguards.

<title>Beyond the Lower Bound: Bridging Regret Minimization and Best Arm Identification in Lexicographic Bandits</title>

Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\"ively aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

<title>MOSS: Efficient and Accurate FP8 LLM Training with Microscaling and Automatic Scaling</title>

Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: With the development of cloud computing, the number of Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for efficient Web API recommendation. Despite the demonstrated success of previous Web API recommendation solutions, two critical challenges persist: 1) a fixed top-N recommendation that cannot accommodate the varying API cardinality requirements of different mashups, and 2) these methods output only ranked API lists without accompanying reasons, depriving users of understanding the recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose WAR-Re, an LLM-based model for Web API recommendation with semantic reasoning for justification. WAR-Re leverages special start and stop tokens to handle the first challenge and uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance the model's ability in both tasks. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WAR-Re achieves a gain of up to 21.59\% over the state-of-the-art baseline model in recommendation accuracy, while consistently producing high-quality semantic reasons for recommendations.

Abstract: This paper explores the development of learning-based tunable control gains using EMT-in-the-loop simulation framework (e.g., PSCAD interfaced with Python-based learning modules) to address critical sub-synchronous oscillations. Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.

Abstract: The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\times$ and $18\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images. The code is available at https://github.com/Yunge6666/Hilbert-Local-Attention.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

<title>EGG-SR: Embedding Symbolic Equivalence into Symbolic Regression via Equality Graph</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression seeks to uncover physical laws from experimental data by searching for closed-form expressions, which is an important task in AI-driven scientific discovery. Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\log(x_1^2)+\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\log(x_1)+3\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to recall and retrieve information from long contexts is critical for many real-world applications. Prior work (Liu et al., 2023) reported that LLMs suffer significant drops in retrieval accuracy for facts placed in the middle of large contexts, an effect known as "Lost in the Middle" (LITM). We find the model Gemini 2.5 Flash can answer needle-in-a-haystack questions with great accuracy regardless of document position including when the document is nearly at the input context limit. Our results suggest that the "Lost in the Middle" effect is not present for simple factoid Q\&amp;A in Gemini 2.5 Flash, indicating substantial improvements in long-context retrieval.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%. Codes can be found in https://github.com/ddz16/PFRP.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

<title>EndoIR: Degradation-Agnostic All-in-One Endoscopic Image Restoration via Noise-Aware Routing Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Endoscopic images often suffer from diverse and co-occurring degradations such as low lighting, smoke, and bleeding, which obscure critical clinical details. Existing restoration methods are typically task-specific and often require prior knowledge of the degradation type, limiting their robustness in real-world clinical use. We propose EndoIR, an all-in-one, degradation-agnostic diffusion-based framework that restores multiple degradation types using a single model. EndoIR introduces a Dual-Domain Prompter that extracts joint spatial-frequency features, coupled with an adaptive embedding that encodes both shared and task-specific cues as conditioning for denoising. To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising. Experiments on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets demonstrate that EndoIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple degradation scenarios while using fewer parameters than strong baselines, and downstream segmentation experiments confirm its clinical utility.

Abstract: Social platforms connect billions of people, yet their engagement-first algorithms often work on users rather than with them, amplifying stress, misinformation, and a loss of control. We propose Human-Layer AI (HL-AI)--user-owned, explainable intermediaries that sit in the browser between platform logic and the interface. HL-AI gives people practical, moment-to-moment control without requiring platform cooperation. We contribute a working Chrome/Edge prototype implementing five representative pattern frameworks--Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode--alongside a unifying mathematical formulation balancing user utility, autonomy costs, and risk thresholds. Evaluation spans technical accuracy, usability, and behavioral outcomes. The result is a suite of humane controls that help users rewrite before harm, read with integrity cues, tune feeds with intention, pause compulsive loops, and seek shelter during harassment, all while preserving agency through explanations and override options. This prototype offers a practical path to retrofit today's feeds with safety, agency, and well-being, inviting rigorous cross-cultural user evaluation.

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85{\deg}C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed Speeder, a remarkably efficient paradigm to multimodal large language models for sequential recommendation. Speeder introduces 3 key components: (1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which efficiently reduces redundancy in item descriptions; (2) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), which strengthens the model's ability to capture complex sequential dependencies; (3) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), which progressively integrates different modalities to improve the model's understanding and reduce cognitive biases. Through extensive experiments, Speeder demonstrates superior performance over baselines in terms of VHR@1 and computational efficiency. Specifically, Speeder achieved 250% of the training speed and 400% of the inference speed compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM-based SR models. Future work could focus on incorporating real-time feedback from real-world systems.

Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of quantization-aware training (QAT) in compressing deep neural networks, its performance on multi-task architectures often degrades significantly due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.

Abstract: The rapid growth of medical knowledge and increasing complexity of clinical practice pose challenges. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated value; however, inherent limitations remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies show potential to enhance their clinical applicability. This study reviewed RAG applications in medicine. We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use.

Abstract: User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.

Abstract: New intent discovery (NID) seeks to recognize both new and known intents from unlabeled user utterances, which finds prevalent use in practical dialogue systems. Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.

Abstract: LLMs are now an integral part of information retrieval. As such, their role as question answering chatbots raises significant concerns due to their shown vulnerability to adversarial man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Here, we propose the first principled attack evaluation on LLM factual memory under prompt injection via Xmera, our novel, theory-grounded MitM framework. By perturbing the input given to "victim" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process. Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%). We believe that signaling users to be cautious about the answers they receive from black-box and potentially corrupt LLMs is a first checkpoint toward user cyberspace safety.

Abstract: Fruits and vegetables form a vital component of the global economy; however, their distribution poses complex logistical challenges due to high perishability, supply fluctuations, strict quality and safety standards, and environmental sensitivity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive optimization model that accounts for delays, travel time, and associated temperature changes impacting produce shelf life, and compare it against traditional approaches such as Robust Optimization, Distributionally Robust Optimization, and Stochastic Programming. Additionally, we conduct a series of computational experiments using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data to evaluate the performance of our proposed model. Our study demonstrates that the proposed adaptive model achieves a higher shelf life, extending it by over 18\% compared to traditional optimization models, by dynamically mitigating temperature deviations through a temperature feedback mechanism. The promising results demonstrate the potential of this approach to improve both the freshness and efficiency of logistics systems an aspect often neglected in previous works.

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1

Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) raises a central question: are investments in compute infrastructure matched by an equally robust build-out of skills, incentives, and governance? Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this mixed-methods study audits workforce preparedness across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity. We also identify an emerging two-track talent system, research elites versus rapidly trained practitioners, that risks labor-market bifurcation without bridging mechanisms. By extending STS inquiry to oil-rich, state-led economies, the study refines theory and sets a research agenda focused on longitudinal coupling metrics, ethnographies of coordination, and outcome-based performance indicators.

<title>CoMA: Complementary Masking and Hierarchical Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention in a Unified Pre-training Framework</title>

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

Abstract: Comparative evidence on how Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states turn artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions into post--New Public Management (post-NPM) outcomes is scarce because most studies examine Western democracies. We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards. To curb ethics washing and test transferability beyond the GCC, future work should track rule diffusion over time, develop blended legitimacy--efficiency scorecards, and examine how narrative framing shapes citizen consent for data sharing.

<title>Reinforcement Learning Improves Traversal of Hierarchical Knowledge in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is often credited with improving language model reasoning and generalization at the expense of degrading memorized knowledge. We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement "code 57.95 refers to urinary infection") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., "what is code 57.95") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.

Abstract: Due to their ability of follow natural language instructions, vision-language-action (VLA) models are increasingly prevalent in the embodied AI arena, following the widespread success of their precursors -- LLMs and VLMs. In this paper, we discuss 10 principal milestones in the ongoing development of VLA models -- multimodality, reasoning, data, evaluation, cross-robot action generalization, efficiency, whole-body coordination, safety, agents, and coordination with humans. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging trends of using spatial understanding, modeling world dynamics, post training, and data synthesis -- all aiming to reach these milestones. Through these discussions, we hope to bring attention to the research avenues that may accelerate the development of VLA models into wider acceptability.

<title>A PDE Perspective on Generative Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains. Despite their empirical success, the mathematical foundations of those models remain only partially understood, particularly regarding the stability and consistency of the underlying stochastic and partial differential equations governing their dynamics.
  In this work, we develop a rigorous partial differential equation (PDE) framework for score-based diffusion processes. Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\sqrt{t}$ as $t \to 0$.
  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection. Altogether, this framework provides a quantitative understanding of the trade-off between generative capacity and imitation fidelity, bridging rigorous analysis and model design within a unified mathematical perspective.

<title>Adaptive Agent Selection and Interaction Network for Image-to-point cloud Registration</title>

Abstract: Typical detection-free methods for image-to-point cloud registration leverage transformer-based architectures to aggregate cross-modal features and establish correspondences. However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity for breast cancer detection, but interpretation is time-consuming. Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.

<title>DiA-gnostic VLVAE: Disentangled Alignment-Constrained Vision Language Variational AutoEncoder for Robust Radiology Reporting with Missing Modalities</title>

Abstract: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in perception systems for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, DNNs remain vulnerable to various safety concerns, including generalization errors, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and adversarial attacks, which can lead to hazardous failures. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of runtime safety monitoring approaches, which operate in parallel to DNNs during inference to detect these safety concerns without modifying the DNN itself. We categorize existing methods into three main groups: Monitoring inputs, internal representations, and outputs. We analyze the state-of-the-art for each category, identify strengths and limitations, and map methods to the safety concerns they address. In addition, we highlight open challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, and their performance depends heavily on how that knowledge is represented. This study investigates how different Knowledge Graph (KG) construction strategies influence RAG performance. We compare a variety of approaches: standard vector-based RAG, GraphRAG, and retrieval over KGs built from ontologies derived either from relational databases or textual corpora. Results show that ontology-guided KGs incorporating chunk information achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks, substantially outperforming vector retrieval baselines. Moreover, the findings reveal that ontology-guided KGs built from relational databases perform competitively to ones built with ontologies extracted from text, with the benefit of offering a dual advantage: they require a one-time-only ontology learning process, substantially reducing LLM usage costs; and avoid the complexity of ontology merging inherent to text-based approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a predominant approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

Abstract: Edge computing in person re-identification (ReID) is crucial for reducing the load on central cloud servers and ensuring user privacy. Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation. OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods, with the added advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates the need for frequent computations for each target model.

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) remains a cornerstone in video enhancement, enabling temporal upscaling for tasks like slow-motion rendering, frame rate conversion, and video restoration. While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting.

Abstract: The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

<title>How Particle-System Random Batch Methods Enhance Graph Transformer: Memory Efficiency and Parallel Computing Strategy</title>

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

<title>A Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Method with Homomorphic Encryption in Omics Data</title>

Abstract: Omics data is widely employed in medical research to identify disease mechanisms and contains highly sensitive personal information. Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) can ensure the protection of omics data privacy against malicious user attacks. However, FL with the DP method faces an inherent trade-off: stronger privacy protection degrades predictive accuracy due to injected noise. On the other hand, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations on encrypted data and enables aggregation of encrypted gradients without DP-induced noise can increase the predictive accuracy. However, it may increase the computation cost. To improve the predictive accuracy while considering the computational ability of heterogeneous clients, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)-Hybrid method by introducing HE. In the proposed PPML-Hybrid method, clients distributed select either HE or DP based on their computational resources, so that HE clients contribute noise-free updates while DP clients reduce computational overhead. Meanwhile, clients with high computational resources clients can flexibly adopt HE or DP according to their privacy needs. Performance evaluation on omics datasets show that our proposed method achieves comparable predictive accuracy while significantly reducing computation time relative to HE-only. Additionally, it outperforms DP-only methods under equivalent or stricter privacy budgets.

<title>Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using a Licensing Oracle</title>

Abstract: Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models.

<title>Simulating Students with Large Language Models: A Review of Architecture, Mechanisms, and Role Modelling in Education with Generative AI</title>

Abstract: Simulated Students offer a valuable methodological framework for evaluating pedagogical approaches and modelling diverse learner profiles, tasks which are otherwise challenging to undertake systematically in real-world settings. Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives. The review identifies existing technological and methodological gaps and proposes future research directions for integrating generative AI into adaptive learning systems and instructional design.

<title>Hybrid CNN-ViT Framework for Motion-Blurred Scene Text Restoration</title>

Abstract: Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative eval- uations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.

<title>SWE-fficiency: Can Language Models Optimize Real-World Repositories on Real Workloads?</title>

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large-scale software repositories demands expertise in code reasoning and software engineering (SWE) to reduce runtime while preserving program correctness. However, most benchmarks emphasize what to fix rather than how to fix code. We introduce \textsc{SWE-fficiency}, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level performance optimization on real workloads. Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests. Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance. On average, agents achieve less than 0.15x the expert speedup: agents struggle in localizing optimization opportunities, reasoning about execution across functions, and maintaining correctness in proposed edits. We release the benchmark and accompanying data pipeline to facilitate research on automated performance engineering and long-horizon software reasoning.

<title>Adapting Web Agents with Synthetic Supervision</title>

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

<title>Evaluation of retrieval-based QA on QUEST-LOFT</title>

Abstract: Despite the popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a solution for grounded QA in both academia and industry, current RAG methods struggle with questions where the necessary information is distributed across many documents or where retrieval needs to be combined with complex reasoning. Recently, the LOFT study has shown that this limitation also applies to approaches based on long-context language models, with the QUEST benchmark exhibiting particularly large headroom. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the poor performance on QUEST-LOFT, publish updated numbers based on a thorough human evaluation, and demonstrate that RAG can be optimized to significantly outperform long-context approaches when combined with a structured output format containing reasoning and evidence, optionally followed by answer re-verification.

<title>Referring Expressions as a Lens into Spatial Language Grounding in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.

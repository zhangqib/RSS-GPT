<div> community detection, semi-supervised, crystallization kinetics, CLANN, Transitive Annealer

Summary:
The paper introduces CLANN, a novel semi-supervised community detection method inspired by crystallization kinetics. Traditional methods face challenges with scalability and unreasonable starting points. CLANN integrates annealing principles to optimize the identification of community cores, mimicking a crystal subgrain expanding into a complete grain. Through a Transitive Annealer, neighboring cliques are merged, and the community core is repositioned for spontaneous growth, improving scalability. Extensive experiments across 43 network settings show CLANN outperforms existing methods on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in community detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised community detection methods are widely used for identifying specific communities due to the label scarcity. Existing semi-supervised community detection methods typically involve two learning stages learning in both initial identification and subsequent adjustment, which often starts from an unreasonable community core candidate. Moreover, these methods encounter scalability issues because they depend on reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks, leading to higher computational costs and restricting the selection of candidates. To address these limitations, we draw a parallel between crystallization kinetics and community detection to integrate the spontaneity of the annealing process into community detection. Specifically, we liken community detection to identifying a crystal subgrain (core) that expands into a complete grain (community) through a process similar to annealing. Based on this finding, we propose CLique ANNealing (CLANN), which applies kinetics concepts to community detection by integrating these principles into the optimization process to strengthen the consistency of the community core. Subsequently, a learning-free Transitive Annealer was employed to refine the first-stage candidates by merging neighboring cliques and repositioning the community core, enabling a spontaneous growth process that enhances scalability. Extensive experiments on \textbf{43} different network settings demonstrate that CLANN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world datasets, showcasing its exceptional efficacy and efficiency in community detection.

<div> Keywords: retraction, failures, science, citation, Altmetric

Summary: 
Retraction failures are common in science, and this study aims to understand why they occur and what factors make findings harder or easier to retract. Utilizing data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Retraction Watch, and Altmetric, the study tests the hypothesis that the social spread of scientific information contributes to retraction failures. Surprisingly, the study finds that widely known or well-established results are actually easier to retract, as their retractions are more relevant to a larger number of scientists. Highly cited papers experience more significant reductions in citations post-retraction and attract more attention to their retractions. These findings suggest that the popularity and impact of a study can influence the ease of retraction, highlighting the importance of social spread and scientific dissemination in the retractions process.

Abstract: Failures of retraction are common in science. Why do these failures occur? And, relatedly, what makes findings harder or easier to retract? We use data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Retraction Watch, and Altmetric -- including retracted papers, citation records, and Altmetric scores and mentions -- to test recently proposed answers to these questions. A recent previous study by LaCroix et al. employ simple network models to argue that the social spread of scientific information helps explain failures of retraction. One prediction of their models is that widely known or well established results, surprisingly, should be easier to retract, since their retraction is more relevant to more scientists. Our results support this conclusion. We find that highly cited papers show more significant reductions in citation after retraction and garner more attention to their retractions as they occur.

<div> algorithm, spanning tree, network, breadth-first search, graph

Summary:<br /><br />
Spanning trees are crucial for simplifying and sampling networks. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are commonly used for weighted networks, but for unweighted networks, breadth-first search may be a better choice as it preserves network structure better and produces more compact and well-balanced spanning trees. The study conducted experiments on synthetic and real networks to compare the performance of different algorithms. The results suggest that breadth-first search algorithm outperforms priority-first search algorithms in terms of preserving network structure and producing efficient spanning trees. This research provides valuable insights into the impact of different algorithms on spanning tree construction and highlights the importance of choosing the right algorithm based on the network's characteristics. <div>

Abstract: A spanning tree of a network or graph is a subgraph that connects all nodes with the least number or weight of edges. The spanning tree is one of the most straightforward techniques for network simplification and sampling, and for discovering its backbone or skeleton. Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are well-known algorithms for computing a spanning tree of a weighted network, and are therefore also the default procedure for unweighted networks in the most popular network libraries. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of these algorithms on unweighted networks and compare them with different priority-first search algorithms. We show that the structure of a network, such as the distances between the nodes, is better preserved by a simpler algorithm based on breadth-first search. The spanning trees are also most compact and well-balanced as measured by classical graph indices. We support our findings with experiments on synthetic graphs and more than a thousand real networks, and demonstrate practical applications of the computed spanning trees. We conclude that if a spanning tree is to maintain the structure of an unweighted network, the breadth-first search algorithm should be the preferred choice.

Summary:<br />
The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation towards connected services and autonomous driving, leading to increased data collection and sharing in vehicles. This shift raises privacy concerns, prompting the need for understanding how modern vehicles handle data exchange among different parties. A high-level conceptual graph-based model was developed using the ontology 101 methodology, incorporating information from various sources including privacy policy analysis and literature review. The model provides insights into data sharing practices and can be expanded for diverse contexts. Realistic examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in uncovering privacy issues related to vehicle-related data sharing. Future research directions include exploring advanced ontology languages for reasoning, conducting topological analysis to identify data privacy risks, and developing tools for comparative analysis. These efforts aim to enhance understanding of the vehicle-centric data sharing ecosystem. <div>

Abstract: The development of technologies has prompted a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, with an increasing focus on connected services and autonomous driving capabilities. This transformation allows vehicles to collect and share vast amounts of vehicle-specific and personal data. While these technological advancements offer enhanced user experiences, they also raise privacy concerns. To understand the ecosystem of data collection and sharing in modern vehicles, we adopted the ontology 101 methodology to incorporate information extracted from different sources, including analysis of privacy policies using GPT-4, a small-scale systematic literature review, and an existing ontology, to develop a high-level conceptual graph-based model, aiming to get insights into how modern vehicles handle data exchange among different parties. This serves as a foundational model with the flexibility and scalability to further expand for modelling and analysing data sharing practices across diverse contexts. Two realistic examples were developed to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of discovering insights into privacy regarding vehicle-related data sharing. We also recommend several future research directions, such as exploring advanced ontology languages for reasoning tasks, supporting topological analysis for discovering data privacy risks/concerns, and developing useful tools for comparative analysis, to strengthen the understanding of the vehicle-centric data sharing ecosystem.

<div> modularity, probabilistic networks, expected value, FPWP, computation <br />
Summary: <br />
Modularity is a key measure for assessing community structures in networks. In probabilistic networks with uncertain edge existence, computing the expected modularity is challenging. The proposed FPWP technique efficiently computes the probability distribution and expected value of modularity. Comparison with other methods reveals that removing low-probability edges or treating probabilities as weights leads to inaccuracies. Monte Carlo sampling has variable convergence based on network parameters. Brute-force computation, while accurate, is slow. In contrast, FPWP is fast and guarantees precise results. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic networks showcase the accuracy and time efficiency of the FPWP technique. <div>
arXiv:2408.07161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modularity is one of the most widely used measures for evaluating communities in networks. In probabilistic networks, where the existence of edges is uncertain and uncertainty is represented by probabilities, the expected value of modularity can be used instead. However, efficiently computing expected modularity is challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient technique (FPWP) for computing the probability distribution of modularity and its expected value. In this paper, we implement and compare our method and various general approaches for expected modularity computation in probabilistic networks. These include: (1) translating probabilistic networks into deterministic ones by removing low-probability edges or treating probabilities as weights, (2) using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate expected modularity, and (3) brute-force computation. We evaluate the accuracy and time efficiency of FPWP through comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks with diverse characteristics. Our results demonstrate that removing low-probability edges or treating probabilities as weights produces inaccurate results, while the convergence of the sampling method varies with the parameters of the network. Brute-force computation, though accurate, is prohibitively slow. In contrast, our method is much faster than brute-force computation, but guarantees an accurate result.

<title>A Model of Silence, or the Probability of "Un Ange Passe"</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: silence, conversation dynamics, Markov chain model, phase-transition-like phenomenon, intercultural communication 

Summary: 
The study introduces the concept of "Un ange passe" or "An angel passes," a universal phenomenon of sudden silence in a co-present group. The significance and interpretation of silence vary across cultures, impacting organizational productivity, creativity, and medical settings. Mathematical modeling of silence dynamics is relatively unexplored, prompting the development of a Markov chain model to analyze silence behavior. Results indicate a phase-transition-like occurrence where silence abruptly ends once individuals lose awareness of the conversation, underscoring the necessity of mutual awareness for silence to arise. This model not only enhances understanding of conversational dynamics but also holds potential for enhancing intercultural communication, organizational efficiency, and medical practices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In French, the phrase "Un ange passe" ("An angel passes") refers to the sudden silence that falls over a co-present group -- that is, a group of people sharing the same physical space. As evidenced by the presence of similar expressions across languages and cultures, this phenomenon represents a universal feature of human conversation. At the same time, the meaning attributed to silence can differ greatly across national, cultural, and interpersonal contexts. Consequently, a wide range of studies have focused on the impact of silence on organizational productivity, its relationship to ideas and creativity, and its potential effectiveness in medical settings. Despite the important role that silence plays, very few studies have attempted to characterize its features using mathematical modeling. In this study, we propose a Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of silence in a co-present group and attempt to analyze its behavior. Our results reveal a phase-transition-like phenomenon, where the probability of silence abruptly drops to zero once individuals' awareness of the surrounding conversation falls below a critical threshold. In other words, such silence can emerge only when individuals retain a minimal degree of mutual awareness of those around them. The model proposed in this study not only offers a deeper understanding of conversational dynamics, but also holds potential for contributing to intercultural communication, organizational productivity, and medical practice.

Summary:
This study proposes a behavior-based approach to identifying individual contributions in scientific papers by analyzing author-specific LaTeX macros used as writing signatures in over 730,000 arXiv papers. The research covers the period from 1991 to 2023 and includes over half a million scientists. The method is validated against self-reports, author order, disciplinary norms, and Overleaf records to reliably infer author-level writing activity. The findings reveal a hidden division of labor in collaborative research, with first authors focusing on technical sections and last authors contributing to conceptual sections. This empirical evidence of labor specialization at scale provides new tools to improve credit allocation in scientific collaborations. <div>

Abstract: The recognition of individual contributions is central to the scientific reward system, yet coauthored papers often obscure who did what. Traditional proxies like author order assume a simplistic decline in contribution, while emerging practices such as self-reported roles are biased and limited in scope. We introduce a large-scale, behavior-based approach to identifying individual contributions in scientific papers. Using author-specific LaTeX macros as writing signatures, we analyze over 730,000 arXiv papers (1991-2023), covering over half a million scientists. Validated against self-reports, author order, disciplinary norms, and Overleaf records, our method reliably infers author-level writing activity. Section-level traces reveal a hidden division of labor: first authors focus on technical sections (e.g., Methods, Results), while last authors primarily contribute to conceptual sections (e.g., Introduction, Discussion). Our findings offer empirical evidence of labor specialization at scale and new tools to improve credit allocation in collaborative research.

Summary:
<br />
This research focuses on analyzing the social behavior related to the spread of COVID-19 using Twitter activity data from April to June 2020. A mathematical model is introduced to integrate mobility dynamics, derived from real data, to adjust outbreak rates based on social interactions. The model considers mobility as a time-varying parameter, accounting for fluctuations in contact rates influenced by factors like personal behavior and external factors such as lockdowns and quarantines. The study identifies a threshold number, examines the existence of bifurcation, and establishes the stability of steady states. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of relevant parameters are conducted to track public sentiment and engagement trends during the pandemic. <div>

Abstract: Nowadays, social media is the main tool in our new lives. The outbreak news and all related obtained from social media, and mob events affect the of spread these news fast. Recently, epidemiological models to study disease spread and analyze the behavior of mob groups by dealing with "contagions" that propagate through user networks. In this research, we introduced a mathematical model to analyze social behavior related to COVID-19 spread by examining Twitter activity from April 2020 to June 2020. The main feature of this model is the integration of mobility dynamics that be derived from the above real data, to adjust the rate of outbreak based on the response of social interactions. Consider mobility as a parameter of time-varying, and fluctuations in the rate of contact that is driven by factors like personal behavior or external affecting such as "lockdown" and "quarantine" etc., to track public sentiment and engagement trends during the pandemic. The threshold number is derived, and the existence of bifurcation and the stability of the steady states are established. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of relevant parameters are also carried out.

Summary:
This paper presents a model for information diffusion in a network of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can provide answers to queries from distributed datasets, even potentially hallucinating the answer. The model incorporates a two-time-scale dynamical system where opinions evolve rapidly while network structure changes slowly. By using a mean-field approximation, the paper establishes conditions for a stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. Additionally, approximation guarantees for the mean-field and singularly perturbed approximations are provided. To address hallucination and enhance the influence of truthful nodes, a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism is proposed to reconfigure the network based on evaluations by LLMs of their neighbors. Numerical experiments conducted on an open-source LLM validate the effectiveness of the preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper models information diffusion in a network of Large Language Models (LLMs) that is designed to answer queries from distributed datasets, where the LLMs can hallucinate the answer. We introduce a two-time-scale dynamical model for the centrally administered network, where opinions evolve faster while the network's degree distribution changes more slowly. Using a mean-field approximation, we establish conditions for a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. We provide approximation guarantees for the mean-field approximation and a singularly perturbed approximation of the two-time-scale system. To mitigate hallucination and improve the influence of truthful nodes, we propose a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism that reconfigures the network based on LLMs' evaluations of their neighbors. Numerical experiments on an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) validate the efficacy of our preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate the optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system.

Summary:
This study explores the use of local separators for community detection in large networks. Local 1-separators are found to effectively identify densely connected communities, outperforming traditional modularity-based methods. On the other hand, local 2-separators reveal hierarchical structures within networks, although they may lead to over-fragmentation of small clusters. These findings are particularly relevant for road networks, suggesting potential applications in transportation and infrastructure analysis. Overall, local separators offer a scalable and interpretable alternative to traditional community detection algorithms, providing a more nuanced understanding of network structure based on structural bottlenecks rather than global connectivity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Community detection is a key tool for analyzing the structure of large networks. Standard methods, such as modularity optimization, focus on identifying densely connected groups but often overlook natural local separations in the graph. In this paper, we investigate local separator methods, which decompose networks based on structural bottlenecks rather than global connectivity. We systematically compare them with well-established community detection algorithms on large real-world networks. Our results show that local 1-separators consistently identify the densest communities, outperforming modularity-based methods in this regard, while local 2-separators reveal hierarchical structures but may over-fragment small clusters. These findings are particularly strong for road networks, suggesting practical applications in transportation and infrastructure analysis. Our study highlights local separators as a scalable and interpretable alternative for network decomposition.

Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) struggle with content moderation, especially concerning minors' mental health. Existing methods have limitations such as human bias, lack of understanding nuanced content, and slow update cycles. This paper introduces a new SVP content moderation benchmark with authentic user feedback. The proposed KuaiMod framework addresses these challenges through training data construction, offline adaptation, and online deployment & refinement using large vision language models and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. KuaiMod outperforms other methods in moderation performance on the benchmark, reducing user reporting rates and increasing user engagement on Kuaishou. The open-sourced benchmark aims to advance research in SVP content moderation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) face significant challenges in moderating content detrimental to users' mental health, particularly for minors. The dissemination of such content on SVPs can lead to catastrophic societal consequences. Although substantial efforts have been dedicated to moderating such content, existing methods suffer from critical limitations: (1) Manual review is prone to human bias and incurs high operational costs. (2) Automated methods, though efficient, lack nuanced content understanding, resulting in lower accuracy. (3) Industrial moderation regulations struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving trends due to long update cycles. In this paper, we annotate the first SVP content moderation benchmark with authentic user/reviewer feedback to fill the absence of benchmark in this field. Then we evaluate various methods on the benchmark to verify the existence of the aforementioned limitations. We further propose our common-law content moderation framework named KuaiMod to address these challenges. KuaiMod consists of three components: training data construction, offline adaptation, and online deployment & refinement. Leveraging large vision language model (VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video toxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy with rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale online A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the best moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces the user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation increases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several Kuaishou scenarios. We have open-sourced our benchmark at https://kuaimod.github.io.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has significantly reshaped the dynamics of public opinion, resulting in complex interactions that traditional models fail to effectively capture. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with Graph Neural Network, modeling opinion propagation dynamics among nodes in a social network while considering the intricate hierarchical relationships between comments. The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the hierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences across different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover, recognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively capturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset, VISTA. It includes 159 trending topics, corresponding to 47,207 posts, 327,015 second-level comments, and 29,578 third-level comments, covering diverse domains such as politics, entertainment, sports, health, and medicine. The dataset is annotated with detailed sentiment labels across 11 categories and clearly defined hierarchical relationships. When combined with our method, it offers strong interpretability by linking sentiment propagation to the comment hierarchy and temporal evolution. Our approach provides a robust baseline for future research.

<div> Keywords: Competitive Influence Maximization, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Subjective Logic, Uncertainty, Online Social Networks

Summary: <br /><br />The article introduces DRIM, a novel framework for the Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) problem in online social networks. DRIM leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Subjective Logic to model uncertainty in user opinions and preferences, enhancing decision-making in seed selection for information propagation. The framework incorporates an Uncertainty-based Opinion Model (UOM) to capture realistic user uncertainty and optimize the spread of true information while countering false information. Results demonstrate that DRIM-based CIM schemes outperform existing methods in influence spread and efficiency. Sensitivity analysis reveals that network observability and information propagation positively impact performance, while high network activity can mitigate the effects of initial user biases. Overall, DRIM offers a comprehensive approach to CIM that embraces uncertainty and improves influence maximization strategies in online social networks. <div>
arXiv:2504.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) problem involves multiple entities competing for influence in online social networks (OSNs). While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise, existing methods often assume users' opinions are binary and ignore their behavior and prior knowledge. We propose DRIM, a multi-dimensional uncertainty-aware DRL-based CIM framework that leverages Subjective Logic (SL) to model uncertainty in user opinions, preferences, and DRL decision-making. DRIM introduces an Uncertainty-based Opinion Model (UOM) for a more realistic representation of user uncertainty and optimizes seed selection for propagating true information while countering false information. In addition, it quantifies uncertainty in balancing exploration and exploitation. Results show that UOM significantly enhances true information spread and maintains influence against advanced false information strategies. DRIM-based CIM schemes outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to 57% and 88% in influence while being up to 48% and 77% faster. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher network observability and greater information propagation boost performance, while high network activity mitigates the effect of users' initial biases.

Summary: 
The study aimed to investigate the impact of anonymous information on individuals' opinions. Through an online experiment with participants from the U.S., the results showed that anonymous comments can influence up to half of the participants' opinion selections, potentially altering popularity rankings. Agent-based modeling was used to understand how this influence occurs, revealing a straightforward mechanism at play. The study also found that the strength of influence lessens as participants' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, participants with higher confidence in their initial opinions were less likely to change them based on anonymous information. This study emphasizes the significant role that anonymous information from social media can play in shaping individuals' opinions, indicating the need for caution and critical thinking when consuming such content.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase, each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions. Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the number of change opinions.

<div> Electric Vehicles, Charging Infrastructure, Graph Model, Time Granularity, Causality <br />
<br />
Summary: This study explores the relationship between Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and Charging Infrastructure (CI) growth in 137 counties across six states in the U.S. Using a graph model and different time granularities, the analysis reveals that lower levels of time granularity lead to more homogeneous clusters, showing differences in EV adoption and CI growth. Causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth are identified, with causality more prevalent in Early Adoption scenarios compared to Late Adoption ones. However, causal effects in Early Adoption are slower than in Late Adoption. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the complex dynamics between EV adoption and CI growth to facilitate the widespread adoption of electrified vehicles and address challenges in reducing CO2 emissions and natural resource depletion. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The increasing global demand for conventional energy has led to significant challenges, particularly due to rising CO2 emissions and the depletion of natural resources. In the U.S., light-duty vehicles contribute significantly to transportation sector emissions, prompting a global shift toward electrified vehicles (EVs). Among the challenges that thwart the widespread adoption of EVs is the insufficient charging infrastructure (CI). This study focuses on exploring the complex relationship between EV adoption and CI growth. Employing a graph theoretic approach, we propose a graph model to analyze correlations between EV adoption and CI growth across 137 counties in six states. We examine how different time granularities impact these correlations in two distinct scenarios: Early Adoption and Late Adoption. Further, we conduct causality tests to assess the directional relationship between EV adoption and CI growth in both scenarios. Our main findings reveal that analysis using lower levels of time granularity result in more homogeneous clusters, with notable differences between clusters in EV adoption and those in CI growth. Additionally, we identify causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth in 137 counties, and show that causality is observed more frequently in Early Adoption scenarios than in Late Adoption ones. However, the causal effects in Early Adoption are slower than those in Late Adoption.

<div> dynamic multi-view clustering, matrix factorization, recommender systems, representation learning, interpretability

Summary:<br /><br />Matrix Factorization with Dynamic Multi-view Clustering (MFDMC) is proposed as a unified framework for efficient and comprehensive representation learning in recommender systems. MFDMC addresses the challenges of large-scale applications by performing end-to-end training and leveraging dynamic multi-view clustering. This approach improves efficiency and interpretability by adaptively pruning poorly formed clusters and capturing diverse roles of entities across views. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in recommender systems and other representation learning domains, such as computer vision. MFDMC's scalability and versatility make it a promising solution for web-scale applications. <div>
arXiv:2504.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix factorization (MF), a cornerstone of recommender systems, decomposes user-item interaction matrices into latent representations. Traditional MF approaches, however, employ a two-stage, non-end-to-end paradigm, sequentially performing recommendation and clustering, resulting in prohibitive computational costs for large-scale applications like e-commerce and IoT, where billions of users interact with trillions of items. To address this, we propose Matrix Factorization with Dynamic Multi-view Clustering (MFDMC), a unified framework that balances efficient end-to-end training with comprehensive utilization of web-scale data and enhances interpretability. MFDMC leverages dynamic multi-view clustering to learn user and item representations, adaptively pruning poorly formed clusters. Each entity's representation is modeled as a weighted projection of robust clusters, capturing its diverse roles across views. This design maximizes representation space utilization, improves interpretability, and ensures resilience for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate MFDMC's superior performance in recommender systems and other representation learning domains, such as computer vision, highlighting its scalability and versatility.

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of friend recommendation in online games due to the popularity of mobile devices. Existing approaches have limitations in incorporating multi-modal user features and structural information from friendship graphs effectively. These limitations include ignoring high-order structural proximity between users, failing to learn pairwise relevance between users at a modality-specific level, and not capturing both local and global user preferences on different modalities. To address these issues, the paper introduces an end-to-end model called FROG that better models user preferences for potential friends. The model has been evaluated through comprehensive experiments, including offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (e.g., images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model FROG that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent have demonstrated the superiority of FROG over existing approaches.

Summary:  
TrustMap is a tool that categorizes social media posts into positive, negative, or neutral stances based on the truthfulness of factual claims, using advanced language models for automatic classification. The tool analyzes regional variations in stance patterns across the U.S., allowing users to explore how public opinions differ geographically. By connecting stance detection with geographical analysis, TrustMap provides valuable insights into how people engage with factual claims on social media. This innovative approach helps to combat the spread of misinformation and understand how individuals form opinions and make decisions based on the information they encounter online. <div>

Abstract: Factual claims and misinformation circulate widely on social media and affect how people form opinions and make decisions. This paper presents a truthfulness stance map (TrustMap), an application that identifies and maps public stances toward factual claims across U.S. regions. Each social media post is classified as positive, negative, or neutral/no stance, based on whether it believes a factual claim is true or false, expresses uncertainty about the truthfulness, or does not explicitly take a position on the claim's truthfulness. The tool uses a retrieval-augmented model with fine-tuned language models for automatic stance classification. The stance classification results and social media posts are grouped by location to show how stance patterns vary geographically. TrustMap allows users to explore these patterns by claim and region and connects stance detection with geographical analysis to better understand public engagement with factual claims.

Summary: 
The proposed algorithm, Jointly Denoise and Rewire (JDR), simultaneously denoises node features and rewires the graph to enhance the performance of graph neural networks for node classification. By aligning the leading spectral spaces of the graph and feature matrices, JDR effectively handles graphs with multiple classes and varying levels of homophily or heterophily. The non-convex optimization problem associated with JDR is approximately solved, leading to improved results compared to existing rewiring methods across various synthetic and real-world node classification tasks. The theoretical justification for JDR in a simplified scenario further supports its effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy of downstream GNNs. <div>

Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.

Abstract: TikTok is now a massive platform, and has a deep impact on global events. But for all the preliminary studies done on it, there are still issues with determining fundamental characteristics of the platform. We develop a method to extract a representative sample from a specific time range on TikTok, and use it to collect >99\% of posts from a full hour on the platform, alongside a dataset of >99\% of posts from a single minute from each hour of a day. Through this, we obtain post metadata, video media data, and comments from a close to complete slice of TikTok. Using this dataset, we report the critical statistics of the platform, notably estimating a total of 117 million posts produced on the day we looked at on TikTok.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework that combines machine learning with statistical physics to enhance community detection in complex networks. Previous methods have focused on mesoscopic structures but struggle with incorporating fine-grained node similarities. The proposed framework integrates micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures using ensemble learning models. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks show that the framework outperforms conventional methods by achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI metrics. When ground-truth labels are available, the framework yields the most accurate results, effectively recovering real-world community structures with minimal misclassifications. The analysis of the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics indicates a strong relationship, emphasizing the importance of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, the study highlights the synergistic relationship between machine learning and statistical physics in uncovering complex structural patterns in networks.

Abstract: Community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the structural organization of complex networks. Previous methods, particularly those from statistical physics, primarily focus on the analysis of mesoscopic network structures and often struggle to integrate fine-grained node similarities. To address this limitation, we propose a low-complexity framework that integrates machine learning to embed micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures. By leveraging ensemble learning models, our approach enhances both structural coherence and detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI. Notably, when ground-truth labels are available, our approach yields the most accurate detection results, effectively recovering real-world community structures while minimizing misclassifications. To further explain our framework's performance, we analyze the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics. The results reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation, underscoring the critical role of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, our findings highlight the synergy between machine learning and statistical physics, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can enhance network analysis and uncover complex structural patterns.

Summary:<br />
Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems often lack transparency in their recommendations. The FCESR framework aims to provide explanations for SR models by highlighting both factual and counterfactual factors influencing recommendations. This novel approach uses combinatorial optimization and reinforcement learning to identify the critical sequence of items impacting recommendations. By incorporating factual and counterfactual insights into a contrastive learning paradigm, the framework enhances SR accuracy significantly. Through extensive evaluations on various datasets and SR architectures, FCESR not only improves recommendation accuracy but also enhances the quality and interpretability of explanations. This advancement in transparency paves the way for more trustworthy recommendation systems. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, "black box" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems.

This paper introduces a novel voting process where voters can allocate fractional votes based on their expected utility across various domains. By using a voting matrix to reflect preferences, the approach allows for a more nuanced expression of preferences by calculating results and relevance within each node. The authors leverage absorbing Markov chains to determine consensus and assess influence within participating nodes. An experiment involving 69 students on budget allocation demonstrates the practical application of this method. The study showcases the effectiveness of this approach in capturing diverse preferences and providing a more detailed understanding of individual and collective decision-making processes. <div>

Summary: 
The research focuses on the unique challenges faced by minority college students, influenced by their gender/sexual orientation, race, religion, and academic environment. The study examines stigma processes experienced by minority groups, particularly in online spaces like the r/college subreddit. By utilizing a Stereotype-BERT model, the study identifies stages of stigma processes such as labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination. Professional identity posts are mainly associated with stereotyping, while racial identity posts are more prevalent in status loss and discrimination. Intersectional posts, reflecting compounded vulnerabilities due to intersecting identities, show a higher frequency of status loss and discrimination. The study emphasizes the importance of intersectional approaches in identifying stigma processes to promote equity for minority groups, especially racial minorities.

Abstract: Minority college students face unique challenges shaped by their identities based on their gender/sexual orientation, race, religion, and academic institutions, which influence their academic and social experiences. Although research has highlighted the challenges faced by individual minority groups, the stigma process-labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination-that underpin these experiences remains underexamined, particularly in the online spaces where college students are highly active. We address these gaps by examining posts on subreddit, r/college, as indicators for stigma processes, our approach applies a Stereotype-BERT model, including stance toward each stereotype. We extend the stereotype model to encompass status loss and discrimination by using semantic distance with their reference sentences. Our analyses show that professional indicated posts are primarily labeled under the stereotyping stage, whereas posts indicating racial are highly represented in status loss and discrimination. Intersectional identified posts are more frequently associated with status loss and discrimination. The findings of this study highlight the need for multifaceted intersectional approaches to identifying stigma, which subsequently serve as indicators to promote equity for minority groups, especially racial minorities and those experiencing compounded vulnerabilities due to intersecting identities.

<div> benchmark, language models, pedagogical grammar, foreign language education, evaluation 
Summary: 

The paper introduces CPG-EVAL, a benchmark designed to assess large language models' (LLMs) knowledge of pedagogical grammar in foreign language instruction. The benchmark includes tasks to test grammar recognition, fine-grained distinctions, categorical discrimination, and resistance to linguistic interference. Smaller LLMs perform well in single language instance tasks but struggle with interference and multiple instances. Larger models show better resistance to interference but still need accuracy improvement. The study emphasizes the importance of aligning LLMs with educational goals and creating more rigorous benchmarks. CPG-EVAL aims to guide the deployment of LLMs in Chinese language teaching contexts. The evaluation provides insights for educators, policymakers, and developers to understand LLM capabilities in education and informs decisions on their integration in foreign language instruction. Further research is needed to enhance model alignment and educational suitability.

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction. Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination, and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized, theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts. CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.

Summary: 
The study utilized the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to analyze posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, identifying dimensions and risk factors of suicidal ideation. High-risk posts often included mentions of planning, attempts, and pain. Supportive responses were analyzed, showing varied reactions at different stages of suicidal ideation posts. AI chatbots were explored for providing support, showing improved structural coherence but lacking in dynamic and personalized responses. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent and the need for careful consideration in developing AI-driven interventions for mental health support. <div>
arXiv:2504.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicide is a critical global public health issue, with millions experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) each year. Online spaces enable individuals to express SI and seek peer support. While prior research has revealed the potential of detecting SI using machine learning and natural language analysis, a key limitation is the lack of a theoretical framework to understand the underlying factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent. To bridge this gap, we adopted the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) as an analytic lens to analyze 59,607 posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, categorizing them into SI dimensions (Loneliness, Lack of Reciprocal Love, Self Hate, and Liability) and risk factors (Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Acquired Capability of Suicide). We found that high-risk SI posts express planning and attempts, methods and tools, and weaknesses and pain. In addition, we also examined the language of supportive responses through psycholinguistic and content analyses to find that individuals respond differently to different stages of Suicidal Ideation (SI) posts. Finally, we explored the role of AI chatbots in providing effective supportive responses to suicidal ideation posts. We found that although AI improved structural coherence, expert evaluations highlight persistent shortcomings in providing dynamic, personalized, and deeply empathetic support. These findings underscore the need for careful reflection and deeper understanding in both the development and consideration of AI-driven interventions for effective mental health support.

Abstract: Internet penetration rates in Africa are rising steadily, and mobile Internet is getting an even bigger boost with the availability of smartphones. Young people are increasingly using the Internet, especially social networks, and Senegal is no exception to this revolution. Social networks have become the main means of expression for young people. Despite this evolution in Internet access, there are few operators on the market, which limits the alternatives available in terms of value for money. In this paper, we will look at how young people feel about the price of mobile Internet in Senegal, in relation to the perceived quality of the service, through their comments on social networks. We scanned a set of Twitter and Facebook comments related to the subject and applied a sentiment analysis model to gather their general feelings.

Abstract: Despite the significant increase in popularity of Virtual YouTubers (VTubers), research on the unique dynamics of viewer-VTuber parasocial relationships is nascent. This work investigates how English-speaking viewers grieved VTubers whose identities are no longer used, an interesting context as the nakanohito (i.e., the person behind the VTuber identity) is usually alive post-retirement and might "reincarnate" as another VTuber. We propose a typology for VTuber retirements and analyzed 13,655 Reddit posts and comments spanning nearly three years using mixed-methods. Findings include how viewers coped using methods similar to when losing loved ones, alongside novel coping methods reflecting different attachment styles. Although emotions like sadness, shock, concern, disapproval, confusion, and love decreased with time, regret and loyalty showed opposite trends. Furthermore, viewers' reactions situated a VTuber identity within a community of content creators and viewers. We also discuss design implications alongside implications on the VTuber ecosystem and future research directions.

Abstract: The electoral system is a cornerstone of democracy, shaping the structure of political competition, representation, and accountability. In the case of France, it is difficult to access data describing elected representatives, though, as they are scattered across a number of sources, including public institutions, but also academic and individual efforts. This article presents a unified relational database that aims at tackling this issue by gathering information regarding representatives elected in France over the whole Fifth Republic (1958-present). This database constitutes an unprecedented resource for analyzing the evolution of political representation in France, exploring trends in party system dynamics, gender equality, and the professionalization of politics. By providing a longitudinal view of French elected representatives, the database facilitates research on the institutional stability of the Fifth Republic, offering insights into the factors of political change.

<div> Bayesian methodology, partial rankings, pairwise comparisons, Bradley-Terry model, inference-based methods <br />
Summary: <br />
- The article introduces a Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings from pairwise comparison data, addressing the challenge of distinguishing between items with limited or noisy comparisons.
- Current inference-based ranking methods often assign unique ranks to each item, even when there is insufficient evidence to differentiate their performance.
- The proposed framework allows for the incorporation of ties in rankings, only distinguishing between items when there is enough evidence from the data.
- An agglomerative algorithm is developed for Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings.
- The method is evaluated on real and synthetic network datasets, demonstrating its ability to provide a more parsimonious summary of the data compared to traditional ranking methods, especially in cases of sparse observations.

Abstract: A common task arising in various domains is that of ranking items based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, from ranking players and teams in sports to ranking products or brands in marketing studies and recommendation systems. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.

Summary: 
The article presents a computational analysis of Chinese state-controlled media from 1950 to 2019, focusing on how societal beliefs about social groups are reflected in language. The study utilizes diachronic word embeddings to analyze the evolution of representations of social groups in Chinese media. The findings suggest significant differences in Chinese representations compared to Western contexts, particularly in terms of ethnicity, economic status, and gender. The study reveals that stereotypes related to ethnicity, age, and body type remain stable over time, while representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic shifts in alignment with historical transformations. This research contributes to our understanding of how language encodes societal beliefs and social structures, emphasizing the importance of non-Western perspectives in computational social science.

Abstract: Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns. While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender. These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives in computational social science.

Summary: 
This study examines user engagement with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as mental health tools through the analysis of over 10,000 TikTok comments. Approximately 20% of comments reflect personal use, with users reporting positive attitudes towards LLMs for mental health support. Accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value are commonly cited benefits. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight are prominent. The study highlights the need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI for mental health support, as user feedback does not indicate alignment with any therapeutic framework. The findings emphasize the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices while underscoring the importance of addressing privacy, ethical, and clinical considerations when utilizing AI chatbots for mental health support.

Abstract: The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency, empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI for mental health support.

<div> Keywords: social bots, misinformation, Sina Weibo, dataset, information spread

Summary: 
Social bots play a significant role in spreading misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform, as shown in a dataset containing annotations of both misinformation and social bots. Through extensive experiments, it is evident that the dataset is comprehensive, with distinguishable misinformation and real information, and high-quality social bot annotations. The analysis reveals that social bots are actively involved in disseminating information, contributing to echo chambers by amplifying similar content on the same topics, and generating content to manipulate public opinions. This study sheds light on the interplay between social bots and misinformation on social media platforms, highlighting the need for further research and measures to combat the spread of false information.

Abstract: The social media platform is an ideal medium to spread misinformation, where social bots might accelerate the spread. This paper is the first to explore the interplay between social bots and misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform. We construct a large-scale dataset that contains annotations of misinformation and social bots. From the misinformation perspective, this dataset is multimodal, containing 11,393 pieces of misinformation and 16,416 pieces of real information. From the social bot perspective, this dataset contains 65,749 social bots and 345,886 genuine accounts, where we propose a weak-supervised annotator to annotate automatically. Extensive experiments prove that the dataset is the most comprehensive, misinformation and real information are distinguishable, and social bots have high annotation quality. Further analysis illustrates that: (i) social bots are deeply involved in information spread; (ii) misinformation with the same topics has similar content, providing the basis of echo chambers, and social bots amplify this phenomenon; and (iii) social bots generate similar content aiming to manipulate public opinions.

Summary:
The article examines different governance structures within democratic governments through a social network framework. By modeling decision-making as a satisfiability problem and information flow as a social hypergraph, the study explores various governance strategies from dictatorships to direct democracy. The research suggests that effective governance can be achieved through small overlapping decision groups that make specific decisions and share information. This approach allows even polarized populations to make coherent decisions with low coordination costs. The conceptual framework can simulate different governance strategies and their effectiveness in addressing complex societal challenges. This new perspective on governance structures offers insights into improving decision-making processes in democratic societies.

Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions, solving societal challenges while respecting the will of the people. New governance frameworks represent this as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? We model the decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This framework allows to consider different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. Between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where small overlapping decision groups make specific decisions and share information. Effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. Beyond simulations, our conceptual framework can explore a wide range of governance strategies and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.

Abstract: In recent years, social media has emerged as a primary channel for users to promptly share feedback and issues during disasters and emergencies, playing a key role in crisis management. While significant progress has been made in collecting and analyzing social media content, there remains a pressing need to enhance the automation, aggregation, and customization of this data to deliver actionable insights tailored to diverse stakeholders, including the press, police, EMS, and firefighters. This effort is essential for improving the coordination of activities such as relief efforts, resource distribution, and media communication. This paper presents a methodology that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to enhance disaster response and management. Our approach combines classification techniques with generative AI to bridge the gap between raw user feedback and stakeholder-specific reports. Social media posts shared during catastrophic events are analyzed with a focus on user-reported issues, service interruptions, and encountered challenges. We employ full-spectrum LLMs, using analytical models like BERT for precise, multi-dimensional classification of content type, sentiment, emotion, geolocation, and topic. Generative models such as ChatGPT are then used to produce human-readable, informative reports tailored to distinct audiences, synthesizing insights derived from detailed classifications. We compare standard approaches, which analyze posts directly using prompts in ChatGPT, to our advanced method, which incorporates multi-dimensional classification, sub-event selection, and tailored report generation. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative metrics, such as text coherence scores and latent representations, and qualitative assessments by automated tools and field experts, delivering precise insights for diverse disaster response stakeholders.

<title>Robust Markov stability for community detection at a scale learned based on the structure</title>

Abstract: Community detection, the unsupervised task of clustering nodes of a graph, finds applications across various fields. The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method.

Abstract: As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is difficult because a technology is independent, therefore has complex nature. Here, this study aims to assess patent technological fields by applying Technological Complexity Index from a corporate perspective, addressing its underutilization in Japan despite its potential. By utilizing carefully processed patent data from fiscal years 1981 to 2010, we analyze the bipartite network which consists of 1,938 corporations and 35 or 124 technological fields. Our findings provide quantitative characteristics of ubiquity and sophistication for patent fields, the detailed technological trends that reflect the social context, and methodological stability for policymakers and researchers, contributing to targeted innovation strategies in Japan.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle to balance heterophily and homophily in representation learning, a challenge further amplified in self-supervised settings. We propose H$^3$GNNs, an end-to-end self-supervised learning framework that harmonizes both structural properties through two key innovations: (i) Joint Structural Node Encoding. We embed nodes into a unified space combining linear and non-linear feature projections with K-hop structural representations via a Weighted Graph Convolution Network(WGCN). A cross-attention mechanism enhances awareness and adaptability to heterophily and homophily. (ii) Self-Supervised Learning Using Teacher-Student Predictive Architectures with Node-Difficulty Driven Dynamic Masking Strategies. We use a teacher-student model, the student sees the masked input graph and predicts node features inferred by the teacher that sees the full input graph in the joint encoding space. To enhance learning difficulty, we introduce two novel node-predictive-difficulty-based masking strategies. Experiments on seven benchmarks (four heterophily datasets and three homophily datasets) confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of H$^3$GNNs across diverse graph types. Our H$^3$GNNs achieves overall state-of-the-art performance on the four heterophily datasets, while retaining on-par performance to previous state-of-the-art methods on the three homophily datasets.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as mixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their anonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals to conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain one of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer activities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural patterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role, following a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their AML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and understanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks and extracting their modus operandi.

Abstract: This paper explores the nature and spread of viral WhatsApp content among everyday users in three diverse countries: India, Indonesia, and Colombia. By analyzing hundreds of viral messages collected with participants' consent from private WhatsApp groups, we provide one of the first cross-cultural categorizations of viral content on WhatsApp. Despite the differences in cultural and geographic settings, our findings reveal striking similarities in the types of groups users engage with and the viral content they receive, particularly in the prevalence of misinformation. Our comparative analysis shows that viral content often includes political and religious narratives, with misinformation frequently recirculated despite prior debunking by fact-checking organizations. These parallels suggest that closed messaging platforms like WhatsApp facilitate similar patterns of information dissemination across different cultural contexts. This work contributes to the broader understanding of global digital communication ecosystems and provides a foundation for future research on information flow and moderation strategies in private messaging platforms.

Abstract: Understanding why researchers cite certain works remains a key question in the study of scientific networks. Prior research has identified factors such as relevance, group cohesion, and source crediting. However, the interplay between cognitive and social dimensions in citation behavior - often conceptualized as a socio-cognitive network - is frequently overlooked, particularly regarding the intermediary steps that lead to a citation. Since a citation first requires a work to be published by a set of authors, we examine how the structure of coauthorship networks influences citation patterns. To investigate this relationship, we analyze the citation and collaboration behavior of Chilean astronomers from 2013 to 2015 using the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model, which allows us to study coauthorship and citation networks in a joint framework. Our findings suggest that when selecting which works to cite, authors favor recent research and maintain cognitive continuity across cited works. At the same time, we observe that coherent groups - closely connected coauthors - tend to be co-cited more frequently in subsequent publications, reinforcing the interdependence of collaboration and citation networks.

Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.

<title>WikiReddit: Tracing Information and Attention Flows Between Online Platforms</title>

Abstract: The World Wide Web is a complex interconnected digital ecosystem, where information and attention flow between platforms and communities throughout the globe. These interactions co-construct how we understand the world, reflecting and shaping public discourse. Unfortunately, researchers often struggle to understand how information circulates and evolves across the web because platform-specific data is often siloed and restricted by linguistic barriers. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, multilingual dataset capturing all Wikipedia mentions and links shared in posts and comments on Reddit 2020-2023, excluding those from private and NSFW subreddits. Each linked Wikipedia article is enriched with revision history, page view data, article ID, redirects, and Wikidata identifiers. Through a research agreement with Reddit, our dataset ensures user privacy while providing a query and ID mechanism that integrates with the Reddit and Wikipedia APIs. This enables extended analyses for researchers studying how information flows across platforms. For example, Reddit discussions use Wikipedia for deliberation and fact-checking which subsequently influences Wikipedia content, by driving traffic to articles or inspiring edits. By analyzing the relationship between information shared and discussed on these platforms, our dataset provides a foundation for examining the interplay between social media discourse and collaborative knowledge consumption and production.

<title>Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations</title>

Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However, grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.

Abstract: TikTok is now a massive platform, and has a deep impact on global events. But for all the preliminary studies done on it, there are still issues with determining fundamental characteristics of the platform. We develop a method to extract a representative sample from a specific time range on TikTok, and use it to collect >99\% of posts from a full hour on the platform, alongside a dataset of >99\% of posts from a single minute from each hour of a day. Through this, we obtain post metadata, video media data, and comments from a close to complete slice of TikTok. Using this dataset, we report the critical statistics of the platform, notably estimating a total of 117 million posts produced on the day we looked at on TikTok.

<div> machine learning, community detection, complex networks, ensemble learning, structural patterns

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework that combines machine learning with statistical physics to enhance community detection in complex networks. Previous methods have focused on mesoscopic structures but struggle with incorporating fine-grained node similarities. The proposed framework integrates micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures using ensemble learning models. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks show that the framework outperforms conventional methods by achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI metrics. When ground-truth labels are available, the framework yields the most accurate results, effectively recovering real-world community structures with minimal misclassifications. The analysis of the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics indicates a strong relationship, emphasizing the importance of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, the study highlights the synergistic relationship between machine learning and statistical physics in uncovering complex structural patterns in networks.

Abstract: Community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the structural organization of complex networks. Previous methods, particularly those from statistical physics, primarily focus on the analysis of mesoscopic network structures and often struggle to integrate fine-grained node similarities. To address this limitation, we propose a low-complexity framework that integrates machine learning to embed micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures. By leveraging ensemble learning models, our approach enhances both structural coherence and detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI. Notably, when ground-truth labels are available, our approach yields the most accurate detection results, effectively recovering real-world community structures while minimizing misclassifications. To further explain our framework's performance, we analyze the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics. The results reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation, underscoring the critical role of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, our findings highlight the synergy between machine learning and statistical physics, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can enhance network analysis and uncover complex structural patterns.

<div> Session-based Recommendation, Explanation, FCESR, Factual, Counterfactual<br />
Summary:<br />
Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems often lack transparency in their recommendations. The FCESR framework aims to provide explanations for SR models by highlighting both factual and counterfactual factors influencing recommendations. This novel approach uses combinatorial optimization and reinforcement learning to identify the critical sequence of items impacting recommendations. By incorporating factual and counterfactual insights into a contrastive learning paradigm, the framework enhances SR accuracy significantly. Through extensive evaluations on various datasets and SR architectures, FCESR not only improves recommendation accuracy but also enhances the quality and interpretability of explanations. This advancement in transparency paves the way for more trustworthy recommendation systems. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, "black box" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems.

<div> Fractional Votes, Expected Utility, Voting Matrix, Absorbing Markov Chains, Budget Allocation <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel voting process where voters can allocate fractional votes based on their expected utility across various domains. By using a voting matrix to reflect preferences, the approach allows for a more nuanced expression of preferences by calculating results and relevance within each node. The authors leverage absorbing Markov chains to determine consensus and assess influence within participating nodes. An experiment involving 69 students on budget allocation demonstrates the practical application of this method. The study showcases the effectiveness of this approach in capturing diverse preferences and providing a more detailed understanding of individual and collective decision-making processes. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a voting process in which voters allocate fractional votes to their expected utility in different domains: over proposals, other participants, and sets containing proposals and participants. This approach allows for a more nuanced expression of preferences by calculating the result and relevance within each node. We modeled this by creating a voting matrix that reflects their preference. We use absorbing Markov chains to gain the consensus, and also calculate the influence within the participating nodes. We illustrate this method in action through an experiment with 69 students using a budget allocation topic.

<div> stigma, minority students, college, stereotype, discrimination
<br />
Summary: 
The research focuses on the unique challenges faced by minority college students, influenced by their gender/sexual orientation, race, religion, and academic environment. The study examines stigma processes experienced by minority groups, particularly in online spaces like the r/college subreddit. By utilizing a Stereotype-BERT model, the study identifies stages of stigma processes such as labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination. Professional identity posts are mainly associated with stereotyping, while racial identity posts are more prevalent in status loss and discrimination. Intersectional posts, reflecting compounded vulnerabilities due to intersecting identities, show a higher frequency of status loss and discrimination. The study emphasizes the importance of intersectional approaches in identifying stigma processes to promote equity for minority groups, especially racial minorities.

Abstract: Minority college students face unique challenges shaped by their identities based on their gender/sexual orientation, race, religion, and academic institutions, which influence their academic and social experiences. Although research has highlighted the challenges faced by individual minority groups, the stigma process-labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination-that underpin these experiences remains underexamined, particularly in the online spaces where college students are highly active. We address these gaps by examining posts on subreddit, r/college, as indicators for stigma processes, our approach applies a Stereotype-BERT model, including stance toward each stereotype. We extend the stereotype model to encompass status loss and discrimination by using semantic distance with their reference sentences. Our analyses show that professional indicated posts are primarily labeled under the stereotyping stage, whereas posts indicating racial are highly represented in status loss and discrimination. Intersectional identified posts are more frequently associated with status loss and discrimination. The findings of this study highlight the need for multifaceted intersectional approaches to identifying stigma, which subsequently serve as indicators to promote equity for minority groups, especially racial minorities and those experiencing compounded vulnerabilities due to intersecting identities.

<div> benchmark, language models, pedagogical grammar, foreign language education, evaluation 
Summary: 

The paper introduces CPG-EVAL, a benchmark designed to assess large language models' (LLMs) knowledge of pedagogical grammar in foreign language instruction. The benchmark includes tasks to test grammar recognition, fine-grained distinctions, categorical discrimination, and resistance to linguistic interference. Smaller LLMs perform well in single language instance tasks but struggle with interference and multiple instances. Larger models show better resistance to interference but still need accuracy improvement. The study emphasizes the importance of aligning LLMs with educational goals and creating more rigorous benchmarks. CPG-EVAL aims to guide the deployment of LLMs in Chinese language teaching contexts. The evaluation provides insights for educators, policymakers, and developers to understand LLM capabilities in education and informs decisions on their integration in foreign language instruction. Further research is needed to enhance model alignment and educational suitability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction. Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination, and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized, theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts. CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.

<div> Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, Suicidal Ideation, Machine Learning, Natural Language Analysis, AI Chatbots
<br />
Summary: 
The study utilized the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to analyze posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, identifying dimensions and risk factors of suicidal ideation. High-risk posts often included mentions of planning, attempts, and pain. Supportive responses were analyzed, showing varied reactions at different stages of suicidal ideation posts. AI chatbots were explored for providing support, showing improved structural coherence but lacking in dynamic and personalized responses. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent and the need for careful consideration in developing AI-driven interventions for mental health support. <div>
arXiv:2504.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicide is a critical global public health issue, with millions experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) each year. Online spaces enable individuals to express SI and seek peer support. While prior research has revealed the potential of detecting SI using machine learning and natural language analysis, a key limitation is the lack of a theoretical framework to understand the underlying factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent. To bridge this gap, we adopted the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) as an analytic lens to analyze 59,607 posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, categorizing them into SI dimensions (Loneliness, Lack of Reciprocal Love, Self Hate, and Liability) and risk factors (Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Acquired Capability of Suicide). We found that high-risk SI posts express planning and attempts, methods and tools, and weaknesses and pain. In addition, we also examined the language of supportive responses through psycholinguistic and content analyses to find that individuals respond differently to different stages of Suicidal Ideation (SI) posts. Finally, we explored the role of AI chatbots in providing effective supportive responses to suicidal ideation posts. We found that although AI improved structural coherence, expert evaluations highlight persistent shortcomings in providing dynamic, personalized, and deeply empathetic support. These findings underscore the need for careful reflection and deeper understanding in both the development and consideration of AI-driven interventions for effective mental health support.

Abstract: Despite the significant increase in popularity of Virtual YouTubers (VTubers), research on the unique dynamics of viewer-VTuber parasocial relationships is nascent. This work investigates how English-speaking viewers grieved VTubers whose identities are no longer used, an interesting context as the nakanohito (i.e., the person behind the VTuber identity) is usually alive post-retirement and might "reincarnate" as another VTuber. We propose a typology for VTuber retirements and analyzed 13,655 Reddit posts and comments spanning nearly three years using mixed-methods. Findings include how viewers coped using methods similar to when losing loved ones, alongside novel coping methods reflecting different attachment styles. Although emotions like sadness, shock, concern, disapproval, confusion, and love decreased with time, regret and loyalty showed opposite trends. Furthermore, viewers' reactions situated a VTuber identity within a community of content creators and viewers. We also discuss design implications alongside implications on the VTuber ecosystem and future research directions.

Summary: <br />
- The article introduces a Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings from pairwise comparison data, addressing the challenge of distinguishing between items with limited or noisy comparisons.
- Current inference-based ranking methods often assign unique ranks to each item, even when there is insufficient evidence to differentiate their performance.
- The proposed framework allows for the incorporation of ties in rankings, only distinguishing between items when there is enough evidence from the data.
- An agglomerative algorithm is developed for Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings.
- The method is evaluated on real and synthetic network datasets, demonstrating its ability to provide a more parsimonious summary of the data compared to traditional ranking methods, especially in cases of sparse observations.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2501.02505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common task arising in various domains is that of ranking items based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, from ranking players and teams in sports to ranking products or brands in marketing studies and recommendation systems. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.

Summary: 
The article presents a computational analysis of Chinese state-controlled media from 1950 to 2019, focusing on how societal beliefs about social groups are reflected in language. The study utilizes diachronic word embeddings to analyze the evolution of representations of social groups in Chinese media. The findings suggest significant differences in Chinese representations compared to Western contexts, particularly in terms of ethnicity, economic status, and gender. The study reveals that stereotypes related to ethnicity, age, and body type remain stable over time, while representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic shifts in alignment with historical transformations. This research contributes to our understanding of how language encodes societal beliefs and social structures, emphasizing the importance of non-Western perspectives in computational social science. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns. While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender. These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives in computational social science.

<div> mental health support, AI chatbots, user engagement, TikTok comments, ethical scrutiny 
Summary: 
This study examines user engagement with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as mental health tools through the analysis of over 10,000 TikTok comments. Approximately 20% of comments reflect personal use, with users reporting positive attitudes towards LLMs for mental health support. Accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value are commonly cited benefits.

Abstract: The emergence of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has prompted growing public and academic interest in their role as informal mental health support tools. While early rule-based systems have been around for several years, large language models (LLMs) offer new capabilities in conversational fluency, empathy simulation, and availability. This study explores how users engage with LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI for mental health support.

<div> Keywords: social bots, misinformation, Sina Weibo, dataset, information spread

Summary: 
Social bots play a significant role in spreading misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform, as shown in a dataset containing annotations of both misinformation and social bots. Through extensive experiments, it is evident that the dataset is comprehensive, with distinguishable misinformation and real information, and high-quality social bot annotations. The analysis reveals that social bots are actively involved in disseminating information, contributing to echo chambers by amplifying similar content on the same topics, and generating content to manipulate public opinions. This study sheds light on the interplay between social bots and misinformation on social media platforms, highlighting the need for further research and measures to combat the spread of false information.

Abstract: The social media platform is an ideal medium to spread misinformation, where social bots might accelerate the spread. This paper is the first to explore the interplay between social bots and misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform. We construct a large-scale dataset that contains annotations of misinformation and social bots. From the misinformation perspective, this dataset is multimodal, containing 11,393 pieces of misinformation and 16,416 pieces of real information. From the social bot perspective, this dataset contains 65,749 social bots and 345,886 genuine accounts, where we propose a weak-supervised annotator to annotate automatically. Extensive experiments prove that the dataset is the most comprehensive, misinformation and real information are distinguishable, and social bots have high annotation quality. Further analysis illustrates that: (i) social bots are deeply involved in information spread; (ii) misinformation with the same topics has similar content, providing the basis of echo chambers, and social bots amplify this phenomenon; and (iii) social bots generate similar content aiming to manipulate public opinions.

<div> modeling, governance structures, decision-making, social network, democratic governments

Summary:
The article examines different governance structures within democratic governments through a social network framework. By modeling decision-making as a satisfiability problem and information flow as a social hypergraph, the study explores various governance strategies from dictatorships to direct democracy. The research suggests that effective governance can be achieved through small overlapping decision groups that make specific decisions and share information. This approach allows even polarized populations to make coherent decisions with low coordination costs. The conceptual framework can simulate different governance strategies and their effectiveness in addressing complex societal challenges. This new perspective on governance structures offers insights into improving decision-making processes in democratic societies.

Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions, solving societal challenges while respecting the will of the people. New governance frameworks represent this as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? We model the decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This framework allows to consider different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. Between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where small overlapping decision groups make specific decisions and share information. Effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. Beyond simulations, our conceptual framework can explore a wide range of governance strategies and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.

Abstract: In recent years, social media has emerged as a primary channel for users to promptly share feedback and issues during disasters and emergencies, playing a key role in crisis management. While significant progress has been made in collecting and analyzing social media content, there remains a pressing need to enhance the automation, aggregation, and customization of this data to deliver actionable insights tailored to diverse stakeholders, including the press, police, EMS, and firefighters. This effort is essential for improving the coordination of activities such as relief efforts, resource distribution, and media communication. This paper presents a methodology that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to enhance disaster response and management. Our approach combines classification techniques with generative AI to bridge the gap between raw user feedback and stakeholder-specific reports. Social media posts shared during catastrophic events are analyzed with a focus on user-reported issues, service interruptions, and encountered challenges. We employ full-spectrum LLMs, using analytical models like BERT for precise, multi-dimensional classification of content type, sentiment, emotion, geolocation, and topic. Generative models such as ChatGPT are then used to produce human-readable, informative reports tailored to distinct audiences, synthesizing insights derived from detailed classifications. We compare standard approaches, which analyze posts directly using prompts in ChatGPT, to our advanced method, which incorporates multi-dimensional classification, sub-event selection, and tailored report generation. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative metrics, such as text coherence scores and latent representations, and qualitative assessments by automated tools and field experts, delivering precise insights for diverse disaster response stakeholders.

Abstract: In contemporary society, widespread social media usage is evident in people's daily lives. Nevertheless, disparities in emotional expressions between the real world and online platforms can manifest. We comprehensively analyzed Persian community on X to explore this phenomenon. An innovative pipeline was designed to measure the similarity between emotions in the real world compared to social media. Accordingly, recent tweets and images of participants were gathered and analyzed using Transformers-based text and image sentiment analysis modules. Each participant's friends also provided insights into the their real-world emotions. A distance criterion was used to compare real-world feelings with virtual experiences. Our study encompassed N=105 participants, 393 friends who contributed their perspectives, over 8,300 collected tweets, and 2,000 media images. Results indicated a 28.67% similarity between images and real-world emotions, while tweets exhibited a 75.88% alignment with real-world feelings. Additionally, the statistical significance confirmed that the observed disparities in sentiment proportions.

<title>Robust Markov stability for community detection at a scale learned based on the structure</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11621</link>

Abstract: Community detection, the unsupervised task of clustering nodes of a graph, finds applications across various fields. The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method.

Abstract: As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is difficult because a technology is independent, therefore has complex nature. Here, this study aims to assess patent technological fields by applying Technological Complexity Index from a corporate perspective, addressing its underutilization in Japan despite its potential. By utilizing carefully processed patent data from fiscal years 1981 to 2010, we analyze the bipartite network which consists of 1,938 corporations and 35 or 124 technological fields. Our findings provide quantitative characteristics of ubiquity and sophistication for patent fields, the detailed technological trends that reflect the social context, and methodological stability for policymakers and researchers, contributing to targeted innovation strategies in Japan.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle to balance heterophily and homophily in representation learning, a challenge further amplified in self-supervised settings. We propose H$^3$GNNs, an end-to-end self-supervised learning framework that harmonizes both structural properties through two key innovations: (i) Joint Structural Node Encoding. We embed nodes into a unified space combining linear and non-linear feature projections with K-hop structural representations via a Weighted Graph Convolution Network(WGCN). A cross-attention mechanism enhances awareness and adaptability to heterophily and homophily. (ii) Self-Supervised Learning Using Teacher-Student Predictive Architectures with Node-Difficulty Driven Dynamic Masking Strategies. We use a teacher-student model, the student sees the masked input graph and predicts node features inferred by the teacher that sees the full input graph in the joint encoding space. To enhance learning difficulty, we introduce two novel node-predictive-difficulty-based masking strategies. Experiments on seven benchmarks (four heterophily datasets and three homophily datasets) confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of H$^3$GNNs across diverse graph types. Our H$^3$GNNs achieves overall state-of-the-art performance on the four heterophily datasets, while retaining on-par performance to previous state-of-the-art methods on the three homophily datasets.

<title>Topological Analysis of Mixer Activities in the Bitcoin Network</title>

Abstract: Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as mixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their anonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals to conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain one of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer activities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural patterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role, following a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their AML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and understanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks and extracting their modus operandi.

Abstract: This paper explores the nature and spread of viral WhatsApp content among everyday users in three diverse countries: India, Indonesia, and Colombia. By analyzing hundreds of viral messages collected with participants' consent from private WhatsApp groups, we provide one of the first cross-cultural categorizations of viral content on WhatsApp. Despite the differences in cultural and geographic settings, our findings reveal striking similarities in the types of groups users engage with and the viral content they receive, particularly in the prevalence of misinformation. Our comparative analysis shows that viral content often includes political and religious narratives, with misinformation frequently recirculated despite prior debunking by fact-checking organizations. These parallels suggest that closed messaging platforms like WhatsApp facilitate similar patterns of information dissemination across different cultural contexts. This work contributes to the broader understanding of global digital communication ecosystems and provides a foundation for future research on information flow and moderation strategies in private messaging platforms.

Abstract: Understanding why researchers cite certain works remains a key question in the study of scientific networks. Prior research has identified factors such as relevance, group cohesion, and source crediting. However, the interplay between cognitive and social dimensions in citation behavior - often conceptualized as a socio-cognitive network - is frequently overlooked, particularly regarding the intermediary steps that lead to a citation. Since a citation first requires a work to be published by a set of authors, we examine how the structure of coauthorship networks influences citation patterns. To investigate this relationship, we analyze the citation and collaboration behavior of Chilean astronomers from 2013 to 2015 using the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model, which allows us to study coauthorship and citation networks in a joint framework. Our findings suggest that when selecting which works to cite, authors favor recent research and maintain cognitive continuity across cited works. At the same time, we observe that coherent groups - closely connected coauthors - tend to be co-cited more frequently in subsequent publications, reinforcing the interdependence of collaboration and citation networks.

Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.

arXiv:2502.04942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The World Wide Web is a complex interconnected digital ecosystem, where information and attention flow between platforms and communities throughout the globe. These interactions co-construct how we understand the world, reflecting and shaping public discourse. Unfortunately, researchers often struggle to understand how information circulates and evolves across the web because platform-specific data is often siloed and restricted by linguistic barriers. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, multilingual dataset capturing all Wikipedia mentions and links shared in posts and comments on Reddit 2020-2023, excluding those from private and NSFW subreddits. Each linked Wikipedia article is enriched with revision history, page view data, article ID, redirects, and Wikidata identifiers. Through a research agreement with Reddit, our dataset ensures user privacy while providing a query and ID mechanism that integrates with the Reddit and Wikipedia APIs. This enables extended analyses for researchers studying how information flows across platforms. For example, Reddit discussions use Wikipedia for deliberation and fact-checking which subsequently influences Wikipedia content, by driving traffic to articles or inspiring edits. By analyzing the relationship between information shared and discussed on these platforms, our dataset provides a foundation for examining the interplay between social media discourse and collaborative knowledge consumption and production.

<title>Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11299</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.11299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However, grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.
